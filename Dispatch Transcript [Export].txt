===== CINEMATIC DIALOGUE =====


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Obviously, I love him. He’s my Dad.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Soothing Voice: Hmm...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: What does that hmm mean? Just say what you wanna say?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Soothing Voice: It's just, when you add obviously it feels a little less obvious. |So, I'll ask again... |how do you really feel about your father?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Soothing Voice: It’s as if, maybe, it’s a little more complicated than you feel comfortable admitting. |Which is completely understandable.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0020a ===
I love my dad.
Robert: Look, I love my dad, alright? I love my dad. That’s the truth.
Soothing Voice: Loved.
Robert: That’s what I said.
Soothing Voice: You said love. |Your dad’s dead, so you don’t love him, you loved him.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0020b ===
He's gone.
Robert: Look... he’s gone.
Soothing Voice: That’s a bit of an understatement...
Robert: How so?
Soothing Voice: Well, he’s more than gone, cause he’s fuckin’ dead. |That’s the most gone you can be.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0020c ===
Didn't know him well.
Robert: Didn’t really know him well... he wasn’t around much.
Soothing Voice: Well, you’re gonna see him even less now, cause he’s dead.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Just so, sensitive. |Listen, if I didn’t love him, we wouldn’t be here, right?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Soothing Voice: We don't have to get into it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Nope. We’re in it now. |Why would I be trying to find the man who killed him if I didn’t love him? |Why would I be doing any of this--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Shit. My nose is bleeding. Thought I was getting emotionally snotty.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Soothing Voice: No, it’s probably from when I kicked you in the face.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. So, here’s what’s gonna happen. |I’m going to hang you off the side of this building, |and you’re gonna tell me where Shroud is, |or I’m going to drop you to your death.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Soothing Goon: Come on, I thought we were having a breakthrough.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Hey, we did. |Ya know, for being a real piece of shit, you’re pretty easy to talk to. |But the only breakthrough I need right now, is the location of Shroud.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Soothing Goon: I’m not telling you shit you fuckin’ loser.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Robert: See. This is more like, how I thought this would go...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Soothing Goon: I hope Shroud kills you just like he killed your father. |I hope he fuckin’ spanks your little daddy issue bitch ass to death. |You hear me? Ugh!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Soothing Goon: Are we outside? |Why’re we outside? |It smells like outside smells!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Robert: Windy up here tonight huh?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_013 ===
Robert: No telling where you’ll land.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Soothing Goon: Fuckfuckfuck-- wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_015 ===
Robert: Hey! Hey! I have neighbors. |Use your inside voice and just tell me where Shroud is?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_016 ===
Soothing Goon: Okay, okay, uh, uh-- Steel--Steel Mill. |Llewelyn uh, Llewelyn Steel Works okay? Fuck.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_017 ===
Robert: You’re sure about that?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_018 ===
Soothing Goon: Yes! Please, that’s all I know!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_019 ===
Robert: Stop screaming, goddamnit!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_020 ===
Soothing Goon: HELP! HEEEEL-mmmphh


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_021 ===
Robert: Hey, hey I will pull you up if you quiet the fuck down.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0030x_Choice_01Line_022 ===
Soothing Goon: MMMMMMMHHHHMPPHHH! MMMMRRRRAAA-HEEEEL-mmmphh. MMMMMMMHHHHMPPHHH!

Robert: Sir. If you want something to scream about, I’ll give you something to scream about.
Soothing Goon: Whoaooaoaononono--
Soothing Goon: Eeeeeaaaaaagh--
Soothing Goon: You piece of shit!
Robert: Hey. I ruined a perfectly good mattress to make sure you didn’t die, okay? |You're welcome.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0010-0040b ===
[Pull Him Back]
Robert: Honestly, it was nice talking to someone about this stuff. |I guess what I’m saying is... I’m really glad I kidnapped you tonight.

Soothing Goon: He’ll be here in a bit. |Oh, hey, after our conversation, I asked him about your dad. |Fun  little tidbit, he was very well hydrated. |It turns out right after Shroud shot him in the chest, your dad pissed his pants. |Betcha didn’t know that, huh?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0015-0220x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Soothing Goon: So, after that bullet tore through his insides, |he still had enough time to know how absolutely fucked he was, |and just pissed himself like a little bitch. It was like, so much piss. |Cause your dad was wearing shorts so it just--

Soothing Goon: Perfectly good? |I assumed that cum-stained thing was already in the dumpster--

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0015-0410x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): System check. Calculate the damage per second hitting shields, |then tell me how many seconds I need to divert Astral Pulse energy to rocket boosters.

News Anchor: It was just over four months ago |that images like this were recorded across the Southland. |Videos flooded social media and our newsroom |showing what many thought to be...
News Anchor: The death of Mecha Man... again.
News Anchor: For nearly fifty years a Mecha Man has protected Los Angeles. |Built by an ordinary civilian with no superpowers.
News Anchor: This first suit was dubbed by some fans as Mecha Man ‘Prime.’ |Three generations of pilot, their identities kept secret, have given everything to protect this community...
News Anchor: ...including their lives. |After the tragic passing of Prime, the next Mecha Man, known as ‘Astral’, |teamed up with the star studded superhero group known as the Brave Brigade, |leading to an unprecedented period of peace in the Southland.
News Anchor: After years of loyal service, tragedy struck again when--
News Anchor: --Shroud, a former Brave Brigade member turned villain, killed the pilot of Mecha Man in cold blood.
News Anchor: But yet again, as hope was lost, a third generation of Mecha Man emerged. 
News Anchor: A Mecha Man for the modern era.
News Anchor: --a bulwark against organized crime in the greater Los Angeles area, until, today.
News Anchor: Earlier today, Mecha Man broke his silence |and addressed the media...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): There’s been a lot of speculation about my health and the state of the Mecha Man suit, |and I’m here to put that speculation to rest. |The suit has been damaged beyond my ability to repair, |so I will be stepping back from superhero work... |effective immediately.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Reporter A: Does this mean you're finished?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Reporter B: Can you repair your suit?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Reporter C: What's next for Mecha Man?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Reporter D: Does this mean your career is over?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Reporter E: How badly were you hurt?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): One at a time please.

Ashley Rhiness: Ashley Rhiness. San Pedro Daily. Do you have anything to say to your fans?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Ashley Rhiness: The public outpouring. The vigils. A lot of them were worried you wouldn’t wake up.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0020a ===
I did my best.
Mecha Man (Robert): I suppose I want them to know I did my best. |I worked as long as I could as hard as I could and... |that's all anyone can do.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0020b ===
It was all for you.
Mecha Man (Robert): Everything I’ve done, every sacrifice me and my family have made has been for the people of Los Angeles...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0020c ===
Thank you.
Mecha Man (Robert): I just want to say thank you for the support... |I hope to be worthy of it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Next question.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Chris Stratton: Chris Stratton. Torrance Tribune. |Does this mean you're retiring as Mecha Man? |Word on the street is you’re donezo.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Are you a hundred years old? Why’re you talking like that?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Chris Stratton: Answer the question, buddy boy. Are you retiring?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Chris Stratton: My readers need the skinny and I aim to deliver. Let’s get it on the record.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0040a ===
Pretty much.
Mecha Man (Robert): Well, I don't have a suit, and I don't have any superpowers so, yeah, short of a miracle... pretty much.
Chris Stratton: Is pretty much the same as definitively?
Mecha Man (Robert): Pretty much is the same as pretty much, buddy boy.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0040b ===
Not yet.
Mecha Man (Robert): Look, I'm not retiring. Not yet at least.
Chris Stratton: Any idea what you can do without the Mecha Man suit?
Mecha Man (Robert): Not yet.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0040c ===
No comment.
Mecha Man (Robert): I'm not looking to comment on that just yet. |That’s the only skinny I can give you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Alright, just one more, please. I gotta get back to uh, just, just one more. |Preferably someone from this century.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Charles Kingsley: Charles Kingsley. South Bay Signal. |So, Shroud kills your father, goes to jail fifteen years, breaks out and immediately dupes you into a trap |where he destroys the Mecha Man suit and puts you in a coma for months...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): I didn’t hear a question in there.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Charles Kingsley: Two parter. First, why didn’t Shroud kill you? You haven’t been conscious for months. It’d be easy money taking you out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Ok, Shroud wanted the Astral Pulse and Mecha Man gone. |He got both. I’m not sure I mattered much.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Charles Kingsley: Right. You’re unimportant. Which leads me to my next question. Most heroes avenge their family. You, did the opposite. You killed their legacy. How disappointed would your dad be if he were here right now?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0050x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Charles Kingsley: Your father, your grandfather, they must be rolling over in their graves.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0060a ===
[Answer]
Mecha Man (Robert): I think he'd be proud... cause I'm alive. |Which, as you so sensitively pointed out, he isn't. |I think he knows that I sacrificed everything... and that I did my best. |Being Mecha Man... protecting my community... |was the greatest honor I’ll ever have... |now I have to live knowing that. |Thank you for coming.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0060b ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0030-0060c ===
[Leave]


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0040-0012a ===
News Anchor: Up next...
Charles Kingsley: Do I want to sue? Of course? But there’s two issues there. |He clearly has nothing left and... he was wearing a mask, so...

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0040-0060a ===
I'd prefer a professional.
Mecha Man (Robert): No offense, but I'd prefer a medical professional to do i--|uuuooowwwohhkay... Ohhh. That's uh, That's okay.

Mecha Man (Robert): What makes you say that?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh shit. They were all skittles colors. I didn’t even realize it.

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): I actually didn’t know what I meant, |but you know what it should’ve been that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m a little buzzed. I don’t really make jokes like that. |I think Visi’s rubbing off on me.

Mecha Man (Robert): That was... impressive.
Blonde Blazer: Hmm? Oh. Mmm.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0020c ===
That feels like a challenge.
Mecha Man (Robert): That feels like a challenge...
Blonde Blazer: Oh. No.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: It’s fine. Don’t worry about keeping up. |Something to do with the powers... it, |it takes a lot for me to feel anything.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): What a sad sentence.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Hey, you should give yourself more credit. |To do what you did, for as long as you did... |especially without superpowers.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Not true. Whaddaya call this?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: I can fix that one for you too.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): No thanks. I like this one.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: Thank you. |So how’d you afford all that? |You must’ve spent hundreds of thousands--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Millions.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): So you’ll understand when the check comes.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: You’re serious. Millions.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Yeah, I basically burned through my entire inheritance keeping it going. |Last couple years have just been duct tape and sheer determination.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Blonde Blazer: Wh- why did you do it?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Do what?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_013 ===
Blonde Blazer: Sacrifice everything to be a superhero to the point of financial...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Ruin?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_015 ===
Blonde Blazer: I was gonna say hardship, but ruin was the first word that came to mind, yeah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_016 ===
Blonde Blazer: You must be completely broke at this point.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0040a ===
I like helping people.
Mecha Man (Robert): I don’t know, I guess I just like helping people.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0040b ===
Only thing I'm good at.
Mecha Man (Robert): Honestly, it’s the only thing I’m good at.
Blonde Blazer: Now, that’s a sad sentence. Come on, that can’t be true.
Blonde Blazer: I guess it could be true.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0040c ===
I don't know...
Mecha Man (Robert): In retrospect... I don’t really know.
Blonde Blazer: Now, that’s a sad sentence.
Mecha Man (Robert): Yes it is.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0050x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: So are you drunk yet, or what?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0050x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Eh, yeah, I should probably be switching to water.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0050x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Good, cause I was hoping after some drinks to loosen you up, |I could learn a little more about you and uh... |if all that went well... present you with a proposition.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0050x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): A proposition?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0050x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, I’m just trying to figure out if this is a fit or not. You know? |Then it’s just a matter of picking the right moment.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0060a ===
Sounds intriguing.
Mecha Man (Robert): Well, I have to say Blazer, that does sound intriguing.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0060b ===
A bar proposition?
Mecha Man (Robert): Well, propositions late at night in a bar can go any number of ways.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0060c ===
Hopefully nothing scandalous.
Mecha Man (Robert): Okay... hopefully it’s nothing too... scandalous.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: That’s actually--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Not water.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): This is like pure alcohol.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: It’s not like alcohol, it is alcohol. |I know because you spit it directly into my open mouth.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: That’s water. That. See? How it has ice in it?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): You drink hard liquor from a pint glass?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: Actually, I usually just drink it straight from the bottle but...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Blonde Blazer: I thought that would be embarrassing.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m gonna go clean up.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): I’m so sorry.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Blonde Blazer: No it’s fine. I will be right back.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_011 ===

Flambae: Hey! I’m talkin’ to you bitch!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Alright, just so you know, I only turned around cause someone yelled, not because I’m a bitch or anything.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0070x_Choice_01Line_015 ===

Mr. Wet Ponytail
Mecha Man (Robert): You know what, you are Mr. Wet Ponytail. |Your superpower is in, obviously, your ponytail, which, aside from being disgusting, has the ability to never not be wet. |In battle you whip it around and anyone it touches fuckin’ kills themself.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0080b ===
Sunglasses at Night Guy
Mecha Man (Robert): You are Sunglasses, Indoors, at Night Guy. |Your superpower is that you’re able to let everyone know in the room that you’re a douchebag |cause you should literally never do that unless you’re at the final table of the World Series of Poker| -- but even then, if you win, you’re still a fuckin’ loser.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0080c ===
Dr. Don't Do Shit
Mecha Man (Robert): You are Dr. Don’t Do Shit. |Your deal is you walk up to people, look threatening, talk a big game then don’t do shit about it. |Also, you’re not a real doctor cause you’re a fuckin’ idiot.

Mecha Man (Robert): There. Easy way.
Mecha Man (Robert): You’re gonna hit me now, right?
Flambae: I’ve been waiting a long time for this.
Punch Up: Holy shite!
Flambae: What song is that?
Coupé: Your mouth, it's whistling. |Come on we should get you to a hospital.
Punch Up: No, Coop, fuckin’ guy needs a dentist. |I got it on ice. Should be able to reattach it.
Mecha Man (Robert): Teeth don’t work that way, you’re thinking of fingers and dicks-- |you, ya know what? Give it a shot.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0050-0100b ===

Waitress: Hey!
Coupé: No, Punch-up, you are literally fanning the flames right now.
Punch Up: Shit. Yeah, you’re right. Anybody got a rug?
Flambae: Fuck!
Punch Up: You gotta drop and roll lad!
Mecha Man (Robert): Thought he doesn’t burn?

Dopple: OUT!
Mecha Man (Robert): Relax. I’m leaving.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0010x ===
Blonde Blazer: Hey, I couldn’t find you.
Mecha Man (Robert): Uh, it’s cool, I was just admiring the art on this dumpster. |Can’t tell why anyone would put those words together. |Why’re you holding drinks?
Blonde Blazer: Nightcap?
Mecha Man (Robert): You’re trouble.
Blonde Blazer: Actually, according to the bartender that’s exactly what you are. |What happened in there?
Blonde Blazer: I walk out and the Bartender’s pissed. |The whole energy is awkward...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0020a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: ...and I almost rolled the heck out of my ankle on the slippery floor.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0020b_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: ...and why'd it smell like burnt hair?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0030a ===
Extinguished a situation.
Mecha Man (Robert): A little flare up with some guy. But it, you know, extinguished pretty quick.
Blonde Blazer: A flare up?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0030b ===
Guy fell down.
Mecha Man (Robert): It's crazy. This guy, he just fell down.
Blonde Blazer: A guy fell down.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0030c ===
Made a little mess.
Mecha Man (Robert): Oh, my glass slipped and I made a little mess.
Blonde Blazer: Just a little mess?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0030d ===
Got fired up.
Mecha Man (Robert): I got a little fired up with a guy, but he ran off before anything happened so...
Blonde Blazer: You got fired up?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0060-0040x ===
Mecha Man (Robert): Yeah. Does that, not sound convincing enough?
Blonde Blazer: Hold these. I know a place.
Mecha Man (Robert): You stong...
Blonde Blazer: It’s a little out there. Easier if we fly.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Mecha Man (Robert): I actually thought you were taking us to sit on it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Hmm? Oh yeah, that woulda been cool.

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0020a ===
Thanks for helping me.
Mecha Man (Robert): I really appreciate you coming to my rescue back there. |I still think I could’ve handled it but-- all I'm trying to say is... |Thanks. I should've just said that... |But, yep I'm still talking.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0020b ===
Sorry about the spit thing.
Mecha Man (Robert): I know I shouldn’t even bring it up cause it was mortifying for the both of us, but I am seriously sorry about the whole spitting thing.
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, that’s usually like a second date kinda thing with me.
Blonde Blazer: I’m joking. I'm joking. |This is, this is not a date.
Mecha Man (Robert): No, totally. I was thinking about something else. But yeah. Thanks. |Thank you. Again.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0020c ===
I really needed this.
Mecha Man (Robert): All this has been pretty... overwhelming, you know. |I don’t get out, often and... I think I really needed this. |So, thank you... for bringing me out. I had a really great time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: How do you know my name?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Oh you mean a name like Robert Robertson the Third?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: The Third?! Three times this happened?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: There was grandpa Bobby, then my dad, who I called dad, but everyone else called Robbie, and then me, |Robert. Cause I wanted to be taken seriously.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: Mmm, a family tradition.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Robert: In more ways than one. |Gramps was the first Mecha Man, he died in the suit before I was born. |Dad was killed fighting Shroud. That’s when I took over... |there was a little inheritance and the life insurance money.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Robert: Just your run of the mill, sad superhero origin story. |The family tradition, if there is one, is dying in that suit. |Which I guess I don’t have to worry about anymore.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Robert: What is it?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_013 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m not quite drunk enough to share my origin story just yet... |but, remind me to tell you someday.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Robert: Definitely.

Blonde Blazer: No. This... I’m, I'm... sorry if I gave the wrong impression...
Robert: Oh no.
Blonde Blazer: It’s my fault.
Robert: I’m so sorry. I totally misread that--
Blonde Blazer: You didn’t-- I mean, you did, but I definitely...

Blonde Blazer: The way I went about things tonight... I’m sorry. |It was all a little loose. A little unprofessional.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Unprofessional? I’m not sure that that applies to this but--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m actually here on official business... how I know your name, the proposition I mentioned right before you spit in my mouth--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Still mortified about that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: It’s fine. Do you remember a superhero named Track Star?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Remember? Of course. He’s like family... that I haven’t talked to in a while. |What about him?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: I work with him at SDN. He recommended you. |Mentioned that he worked with your father?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Yeah, he was the youngest member of the Brave Brigade so, he was kind of my babysitter for a while. How’s he doing?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: He’s doing great. He’s, he's why I’m here. |Robert, I would like to make you an offer. |In exchange for dispatching and mentoring some of our rookie heroes, SDN can make you Mecha Man again.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0050x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: But this time with all the resources that a company as big as ours has at their disposal. |No more paying out of pocket for repairs. |Support staff, the whole shebang.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0060a ===
This is an interview?
Robert: So this was, like, some sort of interview?
Blonde Blazer: I was worried that you might be...
Robert: Crazy?
Blonde Blazer: Unstable. Damaged. Unfit. Batshit. Dipshit. |I don’t know. Whatever you wanna call it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0060b ===
Not exactly professional.
Robert: Yeah you’re right... this was a pretty unprofessional way to recruit someone into your corporate bullshit.
Blonde Blazer: I know. I’m sorry.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0060c ===
My suit was destroyed.
Robert: My suit was totally destroyed...
Blonde Blazer: I saw the report. Studied the footage. |It’s not totally destroyed. Just mostly.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0070x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: It’s a big investment. |It’ll take considerable time and money to get the suit repaired and the missing pieces replaced. |Plenty of time to learn how to dispatch and level up some of the heroes on our roster.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0070x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Your experience, your work ethic, your perspective, it’s all invaluable. |Share it, Robert. You have a lot left to give.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0080a ===
When do I start?
Robert: So, when do we get started?
Robert: Wait, so you want me dispatching? What’s that even mean?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0080b ===
Dispatch heroes?
Robert: Wait. You want me to sit in an office and dispatch heroes?
Blonde Blazer: That’s the idea. But just until we get your suit put back together.
Robert: What’s dispatching even mean?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0080c ===
What if I say no?
Robert: And what if I say no?
Blonde Blazer: Then I’ll hate you forever... and I’ll push you off this billboard.
Robert: Wow...
Blonde Blazer: Yeah.
Robert: And no one would suspect a thing.
Blonde Blazer: Nope. Not a one.
Robert: Wait, so you want me dispatching? What’s that even mean?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0090x ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh. Right. I was supposed to test you at the bar. Here.
Robert: Eh, drunk people shouldn’t be throwing things at drunk people.
Blonde Blazer: Noted.
Robert: Am I waiting or are you waiting? What’s going on?
Blonde Blazer: It was supposed to open up when I threw it to you-- okay there!
Blonde Blazer: Pop it on. This is part of the assessment. |And don’t move too much in there. |You’re sitting on the edge of a billboard.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0100a ===
Robert: Well, it looks like I’m great at this so, that’s gonna be bad for your negotiating position. |Expect a lengthy...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0100b ===
Robert: That felt pretty natural to me... |in that it’s natural for me to end up mid tier. |That said, for a first time it feels pretty...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0100c ===
Robert: Okay, so that didn’t go so great... |but I really feel like I got a sense of where I need to improve to get to where...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP01_SQ0070-0110x ===
Blonde Blazer: Did I drool on you?
Robert: Uh, I don’t think so.
Blonde Blazer: Well, you see why we thought of-- well, why Track Star thought of you.
Robert: It makes sense, yeah.
Blonde Blazer: Meet me at the SDN offices tomorrow.
Blonde Blazer: I’m not done saving you yet.
Robert: Uh, is there a ladder? Or...

Phenomaman: Great idea. Thank you again, Dispatcher. I hope to be seeing a lot more of you. Goodbye for now, and don't forget to be Phenomamal.

Phenomaman: As if traffic in this city was not bad enough.
Brickhouse: Speaking of traffic and going places, does SDN offer paid time off to take vacations?
Phenomaman: Of course. PTO accrues at a regular rate over time. Use it however you like as long as you discuss your schedule with your manager well in advance.
Robert: What the fuck is a PTO?


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_1__Assault_on_Criminal_Hideout_-e48cee ===
Civilian: I saw some scary, suspicious men last night leaving the old movie theater...
Phenomaman: We've located the headquarters of a notorious organized crime syndicate — the Devils of Los Angeles.
Phenomaman: Organized criminals, often led by figurehead super villains, are the scourge of Southern California. We work tirelessly to root them out.

Phenomaman: Oh no. It's one of my arch nemesises: El Diablo. That means \"The Diablo\" in Spanish.
Brainbook: He must have been using the convoy ambush as a distraction.
Phenomaman: And to attack helpless hospital people. That craven bastard.
Equilibrium: Speaking of hospitals, did you know SDN offers a robust benefits package for all full time employees?
Phenomaman: That's phenomenal!
Phenomaman: El Diablo's threat has been el... iminated. The children are safe and sound.
Pom Pom: Got all the kids and staff out safely! Looks like the cops took care of the goons.
Brickhouse: The walls didn't stand a chance.
Sweetalker: I run an ex-goon support group every Sunday. Gave them my card as the cops took them away.

Pom Pom: Speaking of retirement, quick question, Phenomaman — does SDN offer 401K matching?
Phenomaman: Yes, but there are limitations. Your HR representative will have all the details.

Phenomaman: Well well, it appears we've got our first call from a subscriber!
Phenomaman: You'll receive requirements to help you determine which heroes to send!
Phenomaman: Such an array of brave heroes to choose from! How could you possibly pick just one!
Phenomaman: This graph will show you what a hero does well and not so well.
Phenomaman: A hero with a knack for vigor and combat looks right for the job!
Phenomaman: That sounds like me, Phenomaman!
Phenomaman: Now that at least one hero is being dispatched, it's time to get to work!
Phenomaman: I will now return to SDN!
Phenomaman: Let's see how well I did after responding to that caller's well... call!
Phenomaman: On SDN's state of the art graph, we can see an analysis of what skills the call required.
Phenomaman: The more that my skills align with the needs of the job, the more likely I am to succeed!
Phenomaman: There's no such thing as a \"perfect fit\". Use your intellect and your roster to your advantage.
Phenomaman: When a hero returns to SDN, they'll need some much needed R&R. That stands for rest and relaxation.
Phenomaman: Don't forget to review your hero's performance. They won't be sent out again until you do.
Phenomaman: One of your heroes needs you!
Phenomaman: As their leader, your heroes will look to you. Make choices and follow where they lead.
Phenomaman: These choices need the right skill. Remember each of your hero's strengths and weaknesses.
Phenomaman: Sometimes, a hero can use their talents to tip the scales. They are superheroes, after all!
Phenomaman: The way you resolve a call may lead to new calls like this one.
Phenomaman: SDN values work-life balance. When the bell rings, your shift will end very soon.

It appears we've got our first ^call^ from a ^subscriber^.
Don't forget to ^review^ your ^hero's performance^. They won't be sent out again until you do.
When a ^hero returns^ to ^SDN^ they'll need some R&R: ^rest^ and relaxation.
Now that at least ^one hero^ is being ^dispatched^ it's time to get to work!
That sounds like me, ^Phenomaman^!
A ^hero^ with a knack for ^vigor^ and ^combat^ looks right for the job!
This ^graph^ will show you what a ^hero^ does ^well^ and ^not so well^.
Such an array of brave ^heroes^ to choose from!
You'll receive ^requirements^ to help you determine which ^heroes^ to send.
The more that my ^skills align^ with the ^needs^ of the ^job^, the more likely I am to ^succeed^!
There's no such thing as a \"perfect fit\". Use your intellect and your roster to your ^advantage^.
Let's see how well I did after responding to that caller's ^call^.

Guitar Mom: Oh dang it. I'm gonna be late for band practice.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Phenomaman: Unexpected things happen every day. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Guitar Mom: Phenomaman! |Can SDN help me out with this? It's blocking the driveway.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Phenomaman: You can count on SDN to help lift the burdens life throws at us.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Phenomaman: Let SDN be your rock... so you... can rock.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Commercial Voice: SDN IS NOT AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND DOES NOT COVER DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, PERSONS, OR ANIMALS.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Robert: She’s definitely not making it to band practice.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Waterboy: Heh yeah, wha -- wait what’s that?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Robert: Hmm? No. Just uh, the... the commercial. It was weird.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Waterboy: Weird, yeah, right? |Phenoma-ma-ma-man... he is-- he’s like a rock star.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Waterboy: It’s a-- I’m joking, cause of the rock... roll... cool-- cool commercial. |I’m a Phenomafan you-- you might-- you could say--that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0020a ===
Not a great actor.
Robert: He’s not the best actor though. Which was important |for that commercial to be less... um, weird.
Waterboy: He is the best actor-- well, acting when there’s dange-- |I think if, the whole worlds is a play then...he's still awesome.
Robert: Can’t argue that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0020b ===
He’s phenomenal.
Robert: He seems cool... phenomenal even... and quite the salesman. 
Waterboy: Oh yeah. He can sell snowballs to a-- Eski-- is it not-- not cool to say--
Waterboy: Snowman. He could sell snowballs to a snow... person...|anyone made of snow. Any color snow, doesn't have to be white.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0020c ===
Seems like a jerk.
Robert: I hate to break it to ya, I heard he’s a jerk in real life. |Most big heroes are.
Waterboy: What-- jerk? No, no, no, no. I don’t think so.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0030x ===
Waterboy: Oh god, okay, yep, that's not right, that is not right, that is--
Robert: Just--okay let me help you with that. 
Waterboy: Oh-- no... note... not necessary if-- I’m sure I...
Robert: It’s soaked. You nervous? Big job interview?
Waterboy: No. I mean-- yes, but no yes is more-- |my powers make everything we-- moist. |Waterboy is how they-- call me... But yes, I am-- |Yes, I am interviewing and I'm nervous-- on edge of... yeah, yes |but honestly I'm nervous most of the time so...oh okay.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0010-0050x ===
Waterboy: Now that you- your face is next-aside-a my face... I see that I know you-- of you. |You’re Mecha Man-- I... you’re dead... I thought.
Robert: Just on the inside.
Waterboy: You uh... look small-- different in person.
Robert: Never meet your heroes, kid. 
Blonde Blazer: Oh, wasn't sure you’d show up.
Waterboy: Oh-- wuh-- wow. Blazer-- Blonde. A real hero!
Blonde Blazer: Oh, sorry, but I need him for something. Follow me.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Take your clothes off. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Uh, what’s happening right now?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: We don’t want too many people knowing you’re Mecha Man. |A lot of our dispatchers are former heroes, |but it’s better if you keep your identity a secret. |We’ve had incidents in the past. Here.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: I remembered you being bigger... |I was a little drunk-- listen, it’s gonna be great.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Robert: I’ve never felt silly wearing this... 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Blonde Blazer: Until now? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Robert: Yeah. I was trying to imply that with the silence.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Blonde Blazer: It worked. Get dressed. I have somebody I need you to meet.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh, sorry. Should I turn around? Or? What do you... 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: Uhh should I close my eyes maybe? |If that makes you more comfortable.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0020a ===
I don't mind.
Robert: It’s fine. I don’t mind.
Blonde Blazer: Oh, yeah, no... it's, it’s-- sure.
Robert: I mean, don’t stare me straight in the eyes or anything, cause that’d be odd--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0020b ===
No peeking.
Robert: No peeking.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0020c ===
Is this an HR violation?
Robert: Well, this might be the fastest HR violation of a new employee in history.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah-- I'll actually, yeah I'm just gonna -- there. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: It doesn’t look like it, but I am flexing every muscle in my body right now.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Really?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Okay, well you didn’t have to say it like that. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: I, I want to say, again, I’m sorry about last night. |I regret the way I conducted myself. It was... a mistake... 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Blonde Blazer: A complicated mistake... |I can go into the details of those complications with you later.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0040a ===
Didn't feel like a mistake.
Robert: Didn’t feel like a mistake... at least not to me. 
Blonde Blazer: Well, that makes one of us.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0040b ===
We were drunk.
Robert: Look, we were both a little tipsy-- got lost in the moment. |You know it’s totally understandable.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0040c ===
I'll take your lead.
Robert: Look, I’ll take your lead. So, if it’s complicated, or whatever, |just you know, let me know when it isn’t...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0050x ===
Robert: It was a nice night. Nothing more than that.
Blonde Blazer: Yeah I’d like to keep things, professional. 
Robert: Right, that’s why you brought me to this conference room |to strip down in front of you. Profesh--
Blonde Blazer: Are you serious?
Invisigal: Who locks a conference room?
Invisigal: So, uh, you two fuck or what?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0060a ===
Robert: We kissed, but it was very innocent. 
Invisigal: Like, cheek innocent or tip of your dick innocent?
Blonde Blazer: Okay stop. First of all, WE did not kiss, you kissed me. |Second of all, it's none of your freaking business.
Invisigal: Whoa. She cussed. Musta been a good one.
Blonde Blazer: Robert, this is Invisigal.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0060b ===
Robert: No professional lines were crossed. 
Invisigal: Oh, right, right. So, just like, grinding? Clothes on stuff?
Blonde Blazer: Visi, knock it off. I just got a little tipsy at our meeting. 
Robert: A meeting? Is that what it was?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: She is part of the Phoenix Program. |We take former super villains, such as herself, |and rehabilitate them to reenter society to use their powers for -- |are those my earrings?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Invisigal: They look better on me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Invisigal, this is Robert. He’ll be your team’s Dispatcher.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Invisigal: A washed up dad bod superhero with no superpowers... Can’t wait.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: His identity, all of this, that’s staying between us. |He’s still Mecha Man, but that can’t get out... |and if it does, I’ll know who it came from.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0070x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Invisigal: You think I want to tell people our dispatcher's a fuckin' loser?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0080a ===
Powers don't make you a hero.
Robert: Having superpowers doesn’t automatically make you a superhero. |You’re born with one... you have to earn the other.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0080b ===
Let's make the best of it.
Robert: Look, you might think these are less than ideal circumstances, |but it’s something you need to get used to. |When you’re out in the field, even the best laid plans can fail. |So out there or in here, we do what we can... we make the best of it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0080c ===
I'm here to help.
Robert: Look, I’m here to help. It’s what I do. |You have a chance to turn things around, bring some good into the world |and I’ll support you in whatever way possible, |so that maybe, just maybe, by the end of all this, |helping people is what you do too.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0020-0090x ===
Invisigal: Well, I’m wet. I see why you like him. Look at that drip. |What is that look? Best Buy Fight Club? |Fuckin’ hot.
Blonde Blazer: We have a weekly ranking list for all the heroes in the company...
Robert: And she's at the bottom.
Blonde Blazer: She called herself Invisibitch when she was a villain. |We’re trying to rebrand her. 
Robert: Yeah, I thought Invisigal felt kinda corny for her.
Blonde Blazer: Oh yeah? The name was my idea... |just get your shirt on dad bod.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Office Worker: This is SDN. How can we help you?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: We’re not the highest profile branch in the network, |but we’ve got what makes the real difference... great people. |Some of them aren’t even people, and they’re still great.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: One of three copiers on this  floor. Fax. Scan. Does literally everything. |Documentation, one of the three ‘D’s’ at SDN.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: There tends to be a healthy amount of paperwork. |I used to call it triple D's but I was informed that had a different connotation...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0020a ===
How many heroes work here?
Robert: How many heroes do you have here?
Blonde Blazer: Network wide, we’re over three hundred. |Here at the Torrance branch we’ve got somewhere between forty-five and fifty |depending on our roster at any given time, |working different shifts.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0020b ===
Three D's?
Robert: Three D’s?
Blonde Blazer: Dispatching... Documentation... |Diversity is the third. |Not in terms of priority of course.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0020c ===
What heroes do you hire?
Robert: What kind of heroes end up here?
Blonde Blazer: Oh, all sorts. Some that are tired of doing it themselves. |Some heroes who prefer teams.
Robert: And some that used to be called Invisibitch. |Quite the eclectic roster.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0030-0030x ===
Blonde Blazer: Yup, we’re all about diversity.
Blonde Blazer: Lana works in the mailroom, from a different galaxy altogether.
Blonde Blazer: And then there’s Galen... way back there. |Born with super hearing. He’s from... I wanna say...
Galen: Florida.
Blonde Blazer: Florida. Of course. Florida man over there. |Hey, easy on the bath salts. 
Galen: That was one guy. 
Robert: Hey, speaking of bath, where is the uh...
Blonde Blazer: Need a bio break?
Robert: Excuse me?
Blonde Blazer: Restroom. I mean. It’s right over there. |Sorry. At work I tend to get a little... 
Robert: Corny?
Blonde Blazer: Corporate. Dick. |Meet me in the Records Room when you’re done. |If you get lost look for the door that says Records Room.

Royd: Ohhh. Brah, almos’ went in my pants.

Royd: Aurite. Good to meet you, brah.
Robert: Likewise.

[Do Not Bro Fist]
Royd: Oh oh oh, my bad. My bad. |You think I touch my ding-a-ling cuz we stay in da lua.
Robert: Kinda part of the process.
Royd: No need worry, bruddah. |It’s okay.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: So, Royd... like, like steroid?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Royd: Huh? |Hell no bruddah. No. No. No, no cuz. Listen, listen-- |They’re tree uddah guys here go by the name Roy. |So I tink it’s like you know we go scrap, we go ground, I buss you up |and then you know, you got Roy’d. |You know what I'm saying bruh.

Royd: Aye, you think that's why they call me Royd? |Like I’m on steroids?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Royd: Cause they think I some kinna juice head? |They think I not natty bro? |They think Royd not natty?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0040a ===
No, I'm just kidding.
Robert: No, I’m just kidding, man. |Just makin jokes... about your name... |in the shitter.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0040b ===
Doubt it's a coincidence.
Robert: Look, it’s not my business, but... |I don’t think it’s a coincidence. |Sorry.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0040c ===
I don't know.
Robert: Man, I have no idea. I just-- you know |look, I’m just trying to wash my hands.
Royd: You brought it up, bruddah.
Robert: Yeah and I'm so sorry I did that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0035-0050x ===
Royd: Whateva. Ainokea.
Robert: That’s-- yeah. |Nokia...ing is probably best. 
Robert: Nice meeting you, Royd. Even if it was |while we were both holding our dicks.
Royd: You one funny bugga... |<Italic>Mecha Man</>.

Very Old Man (Chase): Holy shit. Who’s this freckle faced fuck? |How are ya?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: That’s an aggressive way to greet someone--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Very Old Man (Chase): Look at this skinny latte prick. You’re bones, Kid. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Very Old Man (Chase): You here to whip these assholes into shape or what?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: That’s the idea.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0020a ===
Do I know you?
Robert: Uhm, I’m sorry, do I know you?
Very Old Man (Chase): Why’re you all tense?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0020b ===
Can you not do this?
Robert: Admittedly, I haven’t had a hug in a while, but could you maybe not?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0020c ===
Why is this happening?
Robert: Why is this happening?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Very Old Man (Chase): What? |It’s a hug. Not a handjob. Lighten up.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Be that as it may, I’m still confused...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Very Old Man (Chase): Oh. Right. Cause I’m old as shit. How about this. |This jog your memory?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Track Star? Holy shit!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Chase: Yeah, ya fucker. |Why’re you accepting hugs from old men ya don’t know? |Oh, and hey, they call me Chase around here so keep it...you know.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Sure, right, yeah, Chase. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: It’s been, what? Ten, fifteen years?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Blonde Blazer: Has it really been that long?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Chase: Yeah, I reached out to this little pissant when his dad passed. |Then he got to duckin’ me like he owed me money. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Robert: I was in a weird place.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Chase: I understand, kid. It was tough on all of us, |so I can’t imagine what you went through.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Robert: Yeah. So, what’s up? |You gonna tell me why you look like black Einstein?  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Blonde Blazer: Sorry. I never noticed.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_013 ===
Chase: Fucker. It’s the powers. |I could move fifty times faster than the average person, |but I didn’t realize until it was too late |that I was aging fifty times faster when I used my powers. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Chase: Nowadays I’m movin’ slower than frozen piss to keep the ole ticker from poppin’ on me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0040a ===
That's cruel.
Robert: That’s a pretty cruel fate, Chase. |What kinda awful shit did you do to deserve that?
Chase: Right? This is some war criminal level punishment. |No, I was just out tryin’ to help people like a fuckin’ chump. |This is why I know karma is bullshit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0040b ===
I'm so sorry.
Robert: I had no idea. |I’m so sorry, Chase. 
Chase: Hey, if I feel another ounce of pity from you, |I will run you over in the parking lot and say it was an accident. |They’ll believe me cause it looks like I’m wearin’ diapers.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0040c ===
So, how old are you?
Robert: Then how old are you really?
Chase: I turned thirty-nine a few months ago. |Went to Dave and Busters. Shit was lit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0040-0050x ===
Robert: So, I guess this means you’re the one person I can’t complain to about losing my suit.
Chase: You better not. |I would resurrect then rekill your fuckin father in front of you |if it meant being able to use my powers again.
Blonde Blazer: Jesus, Chase.
Chase: What? Obviously, I’d let Robert |have one last “I love you” before I... before I |extinguish the light from his eyes.
Blonde Blazer: Was he always like this?
Robert: Yes, actually.
Chase: We joke. We laugh. We suppress our trauma.
Chase: Alright, enough of this feelings shit, |let’s introduce you to your team of losers.
Chase: Now, if I’m being honest, I thought, and still think, we shoulda canned these tunas months ago.
Blonde Blazer: And you might get your wish. Cause if we don’t see improvement soon, the whole program will be scrapped.
Robert: Cool. No pressure.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0050-0010x ===
Robert: Wait, so uh the Z-Team, my team|... they’re Phoenix Program?
Blonde Blazer: That is correct.
Chase: Your own motley crew of dangerous fuck ups.
Blonde Blazer: We’re not looking for miracles... |but we’d love one if we can get it.| Can you show him his desk?
Chase: Sure.
Chase: What’s that arm squeeze about?
Robert: You want one? Here.
Chase: Fuck off.
Chase: This is you. Pretty sparse but feel free to decorate. 
Robert: This computer’s older than you look.|Wait. So, we’re doing this? I haven’t even met the team yet?
Chase: We did the slide show.
Robert: First of all, that wasn't a slide show...
Chase: Look, we like to start slow. |Most people don’t make it past the first dispatch. And this is better for everybody's safety. 
Robert: What do you mean safety?
Chase: You’ll be fine-- And this here is our little slice of the Southland. |Whenever there’s a crisis in the area, we get a call and guess who answers?
Robert: Me. 
Chase: Exactly. Now put your headset on and introduce yourself to these pricks.

Invisigal: Can I get eyes down here, please?
Robert: What does that mean?
Chase: She’s asking for a tap in. |We’ve got access to security cams of SDN subscribers all over our territory.
Robert: Wow. Really? Is that legal?
Chase: Don’t ask questions. Just always make sure to read the fine print.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: I didn’t do this. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Right. I feel like you’ve said that a lot in your life. What happened? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: This is how I found the place. |The old guy, who I assume is Granny, |was laying here when I walked in. |Hey what’s your favorite donut?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Can you just focus? What, you got ADHD or something?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: Yes, fucker. Is it that obvious?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Yes, fucker. It is. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Invisigal: Well, then answer the question. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Invisigal: I don’t wanna sit here and fixate on it |when we’re supposed to be doing... whatever. |Superhero shit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0020a ===
Jelly filled.
Robert: A jelly donut, okay? |I mean I will eat anything if you pack enough jelly in it. 
Invisigal: So, you’re into squirters. You like that gush in your throat. |Cool, okay. Say less.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0020b ===
Plain glazed.
Robert: Just a plain ass glazed donut. You happy?
Invisigal: Not as happy as you with that glaze all over you, huh? |Do you slap that donut around on your face a little |before you put it in your mouth?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0020c ===
The long cream ones.
Robert: Those uh, long ones with the cream inside. 
Invisigal: Oh you like a dick donut. 
Robert: Um, no, they’re called --
Invisigal: You love big long cream filled dick donuts. I got it, dude. |You like your dick donuts up in your throat in your ass or both?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0030x ===
Robert: Yup. You got me. I love gobbling on hot sloppy donuts. |Love ‘em from my mouth to my butt--
Robert: --Howzit goin’? First day. |Thanks for asking me that so you could |get all your funny funny jokes out. Now can we maybe address--
Robert: --the body in the room. |What’re you doing? You gonna poke it with a stick? |Check his pulse. 
Invisigal: Granny is alive. Thank Christ. |I didn’t want to have to lip this guy. |So, can I go now?
Robert: No. This isn’t a wellness check. It’s a B&E. |Let’s figure out if the perp is still there.  
Invisigal: Perp? B&E? Okay, Lieutenant... |Fuck I can’t think of a character from a cop show. 
Robert: Cool, well why don’t you stay put and work on that |while I get another camera up online. 
Chase: She’s my least favorite... the worst of the lot. 
Robert: That surprises me. You guys got similar energy. |How do I switch cameras?
Chase: Just click the side there and you can cycle all the cameras in the building. 
Robert: It’s weird getting tech advice from an old person. 
Chase: Bro, I’m not even forty yet. 
Robert: Weird hearing bro from an old person. 
Invisigal: Dan? Lieutenant Dan? Is that -- is that a thing?
Robert: Yes. I am the legless Vietnam vet from Forrest Gump. Sick burn. 
Robert: Am I doing something wrong? |Pushing that button just says 'Access Denied'.
Chase: Ah dammit. Sometimes people add extra security. |They don't understand it just makes it harder for us to do our jobs.
Invisigal: Hey what's taking so long? |Are you sleeping or something or are you just bad at your job? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Alright, what do we got here...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Invisigal: Perp? B&E? Who’re you, Lieutenant Dan?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Hey, shut up for a sec. You’re not alone.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: He’s coming your way. Armed. You need to disappear.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: Why’re you whispering, you idiot? You’re in my ear.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Go! Now!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Invisigal: Goddamnit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Invisigal: This bitch is a gusher.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Robert: Invisigal, he's still armed. Be careful.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Invisigal: I got this Lieutenant Dan.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Invisigal: Nevermind!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0032x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Invisigal: Got any more great advice?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0033a ===
Duck!
Robert: Duck!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0033b ===
Go invisible!
Robert: Disappear!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0034x ===
Lightningstruck: Shit!
Lightningstruck: Gotcha now, Invisibitch.
Robert: Invisigal, just hold him off while I find a way to help.
Robert: I can use the overhead sprinklers to short out his blaster.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0035a ===
Lightningstruck: Fuck!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0035b ===
Robert: Dammit, I'm locked out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: Granny. I don’t think you know how to use that thing so why don’t you--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Granny: SHUT THE FUCK UP!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I’m one of the good guys...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Granny: You? Yeah right. Don’t fuck with me, okay? |Nobody fucks Granny!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Granny: NOBODY FUCKS WITH GRANNY!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Invisigal, stay calm...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Invisigal: Great fuckin’ advice, Lieutenant Dan.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0036x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Stop calling me Lieutenant Dan |‘cause the joke doesn’t work and you sound dumb.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0040a ===
Disarm Granny.
Robert: Okay, disarm Granny before that thing blows his face off. |It looks super unstable. 
Invisigal: Oh so your expert opinion is to attack the client? Fuck that. |I did things your way and it turned to shit. |I’m taking out the guy who’s been trying to kill me. 
Robert: That wasn’t a suggestion. It’s a direct--
Robert: Hey! Invisigal, are you okay? Hey! Are you okay? Come in!
Invisigal: I’m fine... but this guy... less fine.
Invisigal: Smells like bacon a little. It’s gross but it's also kinda not bad.
Robert: Yeah, great okay. Where’s the perp?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0040b ===
Take out the Thief.
Robert: Granny doesn’t even know how to shoot that thing. |Take out the thief first. |He’s the only one with his finger on a trigger.
Invisigal: You know what, it’s my life on the line, I’m done listening to you. |That thing is gonna blow that man’s arm off |and this whole building with me in it. |Fuck off. I’m disarming the device. 
Robert: No, Invisigal that’s a direct order--
Robert: Oh, fuck. Fuck! Invisigal? You there? Come in! Invisigal!
Invisigal: Fuck this guy’s heavy. Granny’s clearly a fan of his own work. 
Invisigal: Really wasn’t expecting to see that. He’s kinda caked up.
Invisigal: So, where’s the perp, Lieutenant?
Robert: I think he must’ve had something else to do, 'cause he left.
Invisigal: I mean, this is why you have insurance, right?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0060-0050x ===
Robert: Ah Jesus Christ you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Invisigal: This feels like a win to me.
Chase: That was... pretty good. For a first day. |Sometimes people... you know, get electrical burns. 
Robert: She disobeyed a direct order. 
Chase: Well, that’s the problem. |This isn’t the army, and these ain’t soldiers. |They are fuckin’ super villains. |Look, why don’t you take a breather? |We can debrief with Blazer in a bit. Here... 
Chase: There’s vending machines in the break room. |You look like you could use a snack. 
Robert: Are you sure you’re not actually eighty years old? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Sonar: AAAAAAAAGH!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Invisigal: Hey.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Ah--shit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Invisigal: What kind of superhero flinches?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: I didn’t say which superhero. Chill out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: If you had people trying to kill you for the last fifteen years |you’d be jumpy too.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Invisigal: What makes you think my life has been any different? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Invisigal: You think growing up surrounded by a buncha shitbag villains |I didn’t need to watch my back?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0020a ===
I can't just disappear.
Robert: I can’t just disappear, okay? I actually have to face my problems.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0020b ===
You chose that life.
Robert: Yeah, well, you had a choice. No one made you pick a life of crime.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0020c ===
You need better friends.
Robert: Yeah, well, I guess you should do a better job picking your friends.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: What the fuck?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: You can’t just go around--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Sonar: AAAAAAAAGH!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Why’s he keep screaming?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: His name’s Sonar.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Yeah, I know what Sonar means. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Sonar: What’s up?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Invisigal: Then why are you asking why he keeps screaming? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Robert: Uh she was just explaining your um-- |you know what? Nevermind. Good shift. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Sonar: This guy’s weird.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Invisigal: Yeah he is. Look, I actually just came by to celebrate the mission going well.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Invisigal: Didn’t mean to interrupt your little snack. |Whaddayou need it pre-chewed like a little baby bird bitch?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0040a ===
You ignored my order.
Robert: Look at me, you disobeyed a direct order. |How can you think it went well?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0040b ===
You think that went well?
Robert: You seriously think that went well?
Invisigal: No. I think it went great.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0040c ===
I told Chase you disobeyed.
Robert: I told Chase what happened. That you disobeyed a direct order.
Invisigal: You tattled on me?
Robert: Tattled? Are you five? I told him the truth.
Invisigal: You fucking snitched. That’s what that is.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0050a ===
Robert: You trashed the place. |The suspect got away and you got the client hurt. |I don’t think when he called us he thought he’d be ending the day |wanking it leftie cause you turned his other arm into a pork rind. 
Invisigal: Granny would be fine if Granny didn’t pick that fuckin thing up in the first place. |He’s just some dumbass trying to be a hero--| and don’t fuckin say it. I know where you’re going.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0050b ===
Robert: You trashed the place. |The suspect got away, you got the client hurt. |You think when that guy signed up for SDN, |that it’d result in the back of his ballsack getting scorched? |Cause they don’t mention that in the commercials.  
Invisigal: First of all, the place was trashed when I got there. |Second, I’m sure Granny would take some crispy nuts |over losing his arm. As far as the bad guy... fuck shit happens.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0060x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Fact of the matter is that shit didn’t need to happen. |We could have had an outcome where the client doesn’t get fried |and we get the perp, if you had just fucking listened to me. |You ask for help, then I-- what now?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0060x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: I make the calls. Not you. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0060x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: Here’s some advice. |You’re right at home behind that desk. Cause you’re no hero. |You were a nerd playing a video game in a suit your daddy built.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0060x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Invisigal: Now, you’re a twitchy little bitch turtle without it’s shell. |A real hero puts their ass on the line. |A real hero can’t just press a button to make their problems disappear.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0070a ===
The suit isn't Mecha Man.
Robert: The suit isn’t what made me a superhero. |It was how I did my fuckin job that made me Mecha Man.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0070b ===
I'm the real hero here.
Robert: Let me make this clear. You’re not half the hero that I am. |Not now, not ever.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0070c ===
You need me.
Robert: The fact of the matter is, you need me, way more than I need you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0070-0080x ===
Robert: Based on what I saw today, you wouldn’t last a day as Mecha Man, |cause there isn’t a mech suit in the universe |that’ll keep you from being a selfish fuckin’ asshole. 
Invisigal: Aaaaaaaarrgh!
Invisigal: Feel bad? Good. Fuck you! 
Robert: [sigh]
Sonar: You gonna eat those twinks? 
Robert: That’s not what they’re-- ya know what, help yourself. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: What happened to your nose?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Hmm? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Chase: Here we go... 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: You have a tissue hanging from your nose, Robert. |I was trying to ignore it but that became impossible |when it started soaking in blood.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0020a ===
The air's dry.
Robert: Uh, I get nosebleeds when it’s this dry. |The air. In the office. It’s uh... on the dry side. 
Blonde Blazer: Is it on the dry side? I’ll have facilities look into it. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0020b ===
I bumped my head.
Robert: I don’t know, I just sorta bumped my head... I guess. 
Blonde Blazer: Right... when I think of someone bumping their head, |it’s the back of their head. |Your nose, your bloody nose, is the same place as your eyes... |which is on your face.
Robert: Right, yeah. I guess I bumped my face then.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0020c ===
Invisigal punched me.
Robert: Invisigal punched me in the face. But I asked for it. 
Blonde Blazer: Robert. This is serious.
Robert: It’s not. I asked for it. 
Blonde Blazer: Okay, there’s nothing you could have said that warrants her hitting you.
Robert: Would it be different if I said |I literally asked for her to hit me in the face, and then she did it?
Blonde Blazer: I... suppose.
Robert: Okay, then, let’s go with that. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Alright, boys. |We’re here to assess Robert's first shift and aside from |whatever... happened here... I thought it was pretty good.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: What?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Chase: Told ya, Robbie. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: I was watching on the monitor. The work you did dispatching, |I don’t think the Z-Team has ever had a better shift than that. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Chase: We just might need to confront the fact |that it might be the best they can do. |Especially the way the Granny thing went. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah now, the Granny’s situation, that wasn’t ideal, |but I’ve seen so much worse with Invisigal.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: Let’s be real. She ain't gonna make it. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Blonde Blazer: She’s difficult to work with, sure, but I see a lot of promise in her. |Really. Even the other Z-Teamers respect her. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Chase: They’re afraid of her.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0040a ===
She disobeyed an order.
Robert: She disobeyed a direct order. 
Chase: That’s kind of her thing. |It’s why we’re so hopeful you can help her. 
Robert: And I’m happy to do it, but you know...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0040b ===
The perp got away.
Robert: The perp got away, how is that an acceptable outcome?
Chase: Shit happens.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0040c ===
I could've done better.
Robert: I should have done better. |Maybe a couple wires got crossed towards the end there. |I could’ve been more clear with her. 
Chase: You crossed zero wires, okay. She crossed them for you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0080-0050x ===
Blonde Blazer: Look Robert... you should be proud. |The bar is very low with this group.
Robert: Well, it’s not low for me. |Look, I like to make a joke and keep things light as much as the next person, |but when it comes to work... I'm not fucking around here. |If you want the Phoenix Program to survive, |the bar needs to go up.  
Blonde Blazer: And how would we do that? 
Robert: By treating the Z-Team like what they are... a bunch of villains. |And leading a supervillain team takes a different approach |than a superhero team. |I need to be around them. I need them to see I’m all in |and they need to match that energy.  
Chase: Some tough love. 
Robert: The only kind I know, |and based on what I’ve seen, the only version they’ll respond to. |I’m not saying everyone’ll make it, they won't. |And I’m not saying it won’t get spicy, it will. |But when it does, I also need you to trust me to handle it. |I don’t want you stepping in. They need to respect me. |Even if I don’t have powers.
Blonde Blazer: Okay. We’ll do it your way. Monday, we’ll get them in a room |and introduce them to their new supervillain leader. 
Robert: I can’t promise it’ll work, I can only promise that I’ll do my best. 
Chase: Ha. No fuckin’ way it’s gonna work. |But it’ll be way more fun to watch. 
Blonde Blazer: Chase. Some optimism please? 
Chase: Goddamnit, yeah I also promise to do my best.

Phenomaman: The way you spoke of him made him sound impressive. |I only seek to understand. I apologize. |How was his first day? Was his lack of size and strength an issue?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0100-0030x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Blonde Blazer: No he was great. It was great. It was a great first day.

Phenomaman: That is phenomenal. We should celebrate. |Blonde Blazer and I have reservations in Tokyo at a restaurant |where the owner dreams of sushi. You should join us.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0100-0030x_Choice_01Line_013 ===

Robert: For sure.

Robert: Actually, I gotta get home to my dog. He’s very needy.

Robert: Yeah. Right. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP02_SQ0100-0040c ===
Yeah, sounds fun.
Robert: Oh yeah, wow that sounds just amazing. I would love to join. 
Phenomaman: Phenomenal!
Blonde Blazer: Actually... I don’t know if we can add one more to the reservation. 
Blonde Blazer: And more importantly, in order for us to get there in time, |we’d have to hit supersonic speed and Robert here...
Phenomaman: Oh, would he die?
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, I think he would die.
Phenomaman: Oh no. Perhaps another time? 
Robert: Yeah for sure.

Robert: That’s a little suspicious, no?


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_454 ===

Robert: Okay, grandpa.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_456 ===

=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_457 ===

Blonde Blazer: Sonar here was a Harvard graduate who--

Chase: Who will not shut the fuck up about being a Harvard graduate, like all Harvard graduates.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_460 ===
Blonde Blazer: Who also orchestrated some of the most effective Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. Also...


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_461 ===
Chase: Also, sometimes he transforms into a fuckin' bat monster that would eat you ass-first after he emptied your pension plan.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_462 ===
Blonde Blazer: For the record, he hasn't eaten anybody's butt since he's been here. We got him on a meal plan.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_463 ===
Blonde Blazer: Flambae. He --

=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_465 ===

=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_466 ===
Robert: I did, yeah.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_467 ===
Chase: So, you know he’s a certifiable dickhead.

Blonde Blazer: But, he’s also one of the team’s most capable heroes.

Blonde Blazer: Carnival strong man who made a deal with a sorceress. She gave him the strength of ten men. His muscles grew--

Blonde Blazer: --but his body shrunk.

Chase: He’s got all the charm and brains of a greasy bowling ball.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_474 ===
Chase: Prism. Michigan born and raised. Her power is weird. She weaponizes light rays or some shit. A lot of this stuff is a guess.

Robert: Why does she dress like a pop star?


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_476 ===
Blonde Blazer: She's actually super talented.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_477 ===

=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_480 ===
Blonde Blazer: I think he’s lonely.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_481 ===
Blonde Blazer: Malevola, terrifying. She’s got a magic sword and she creates portals that allow her to teleport.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_482 ===
Chase: And somehow she’s still late for every fucking meeting.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_483 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, I’m pretty sure she does that on purpose.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_484 ===
Blonde Blazer: Here we have Coupé, which I recently learned is a French ballet term that means, to cut. Hence the knives.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_485 ===
Robert: That's very clever.


=== Gem_Node_Dossier_Gameplay_01Line_486 ===

Robert: How’d you know about the Astral Pulse?

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Royd: Unreal stuffs. |Like you caught one small star an trap em in a bottle. |Genius.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0020-0020a ===
Sounds pretty important.
Robert: So, that sounds pretty fuckin’ important, Royd. |You said we’re good.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0020-0020b ===
Can you recreate it?
Robert: So, you can just make me a new one, right? |Which is why it’s not a problem.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0020-0020c ===
I didn’t get any of that.
Robert: There are so many reasons why I didn’t understand any of that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0020-0030x ===
Royd: Da Astral Pulse supah awesome, but uh we'll be alright. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0030-0010x ===
Royd: Phew. Damn. Maybe we go for lightah metals dis time, eh? |You know, I actually met your dad one time, long time ago. |First time I come mainland, |he wen catch me tryin’ fo’ steal stuff from Radio Shack. |Den we talk tech stuff fo’ like one whole hour. |Den he wen take me jail. |That's how I ended up in the Phoenix program.
Robert: That’s longer than any conversation I ever had with him.
Royd: Bummahs.
Royd: [laughs]
Robert: [laughs]
Robert: Guess when you’re building Astral Pulses |there’s not much time for talking to your son.
Royd: Mmmm... not so sure bout dat.
Robert: I don’t understand.
Royd: You see there’s gearheads, then there’s science nerds. |One kind garage, the other kind lab, you know? |Yo faddah a good gearhead but I just can’t see |how he make someting like da Pulse. |He no science nerd.
Robert: How would you know this from talking to him once?
Royd: Cause I’m both.
Royd: I'm da one gon fix yo suit.
Royd: That one ovah der. That your faddah suit.| We gonna make dis one da Robert suit.

Robert: Hey, Chase. I need a favor. 
Chase: Favor. It’s not enough of a favor gettin’ you this job |workin’ with those stupid ass pieces of oohhhh! |Who’s this, huh? Who’s this little guy?
Robert: His name’s Beef and he’s the favor. You mind keeping an eye out? |I feel bad leaving him at home |but I don’t want anything happening to him--
Chase: Robert, I would let literally everyone here melt in eternal hell, |including you, before anything happens to this dog. 
Blonde Blazer: What’s your name little guy?
Robert: [strange muppet voice] My name's Beef and I’m naked.
Blonde Blazer: Oh no, I refuse to believe that's what he sounds like. |Robert, you got a sec?
Robert: Sure, yeah.

Robert: Oh yeah, how was dinner?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh, it was awkward. It’s why I didn’t want you to come. |Phenomaman and I broke up.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Robert: Over Tokyo dream sushi?

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: It felt a little impulsive, but maybe it was a long time coming. |It’s hard to say.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0020a ===
Hope I didn't contribute.
Robert: I hope I didn’t contribute to anything. 
Blonde Blazer: Why would you have contributed to it?
Robert: Guess that means I didn’t. Which is what I was hoping for.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0020b ===
Are you happy?
Robert: Well. Are you... happy?
Blonde Blazer: Uh, I don’t know. I don’t think I know yet.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0020c ===
I'm sorry, Blazer.

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: It is what it is. |But that's actually not what I wanted to talk to you about. |I was thinking about it over the weekend and... |I'm going to cut someone from the Z-Team. |Or, you are, rather.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Maybe I’m just looking to shake things up all over the place. |Create a sense of urgency.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0040a ===
I like it.
Robert: Great. Awesome. Yeah. Let’s do it. 
Blonde Blazer: Oh, really? I’m glad you agree. I was toiling over it a bit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0040b ===
You sure about that?
Robert: You sure about that?
Blonde Blazer: Well, less sure now. You think it's a bad idea?
Robert: I’m just not sure how it’ll play out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0040c ===
It'll scare them.
Robert: Well I think it’ll scare them. 
Blonde Blazer: Is that a bad thing?
Robert: Maybe. Maybe not. Tough to say, I don’t know them yet.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0050-0050x ===
Blonde Blazer: The reality is cutting someone towards the bottom of the leaderboards |will show everyone we’re serious.
Robert: I’ll let the team know.
Blonde Blazer: Oh. I already did. 
Robert: I suppose... it’ll be an interesting shift.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0060-0010x ===
Chase: Cut day, huh?
Chase: Eh, she ain’t bad. Those three ain't shit. 
Robert: Did you come over here to tell me that? |Cause it’s almost exactly the information a leaderboard gives you.
Chase: Actually, smart ass, I came over to tell you |that one of your team members is in need of assistance.
Robert: Sonar. You alright? Why’re you sending a distress call |when you haven’t left the building?
Sonar: Could you send a locksmith downstairs?
Robert: What happened?
Sonar: Coop seduced me. 
Coupé: No, I said, “Hey, wanna see something cool?” |and then handcuffed you to a squat rack. 
Sonar: But you said it with a hot voice so I assumed you meant boobs.
Robert: Okay team, I know Blazer mentioned someone’s getting cut, |but don’t let that distract you from doing a good job out there. |That’s what you’ll be judged on. 
Malevola: What a bunch of bullshit... 
Robert: Sorry? What’s bullshit?
Malevola: This judgey bullshit. 
Robert: How is that--
Prism: Yeah. Only God can judge me.
Robert: Okay. False. I am judging you right now. 
Malevola: It’s bullshit cause it’s not like you gotta deal with this kind of bullshit. 
Robert: Uh, also, false. |Of course I’m being judged along with the rest of you. |Are you-- do you not know what a job is? |What the hell is going on?
Invisigal: None of us have had real jobs, dude. How is this a surprise to you? 
Robert: Alright, fine. Just ignore the pressure and do your jobs. |You don’t need to be first, you just can’t be last.
Sonar: What about me?
Robert: Can somebody go down to the gym and help Batboner?
Robert: Don’t ask.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0060-0020x ===
Robert: Would everybody please stay in your lanes.
Invisigal: Or what?
Robert: What are you doing, Invisigal?
Invisigal: Not getting cut.
Invisigal: It’s like you said: the way to win this leaderboard game is to not lose, right?
Robert: Yeah, that's not what I said.
Invisigal: Mm, pretty sure that’s what you said.
Malevola: Bitch.
Robert: Yeah, so the perp that just ran by was Lightningstruck. |This is now the second time that you let him get away.
Invisigal: No shit? That’s crazy.
Invisigal: Whoa! Bro! Chill out.
Chase: I’d normally say cut her, but the way things are going, |I’d cut the whole damn team. |You need a reset, Robbie.

Robert: Then I won’t just kick you out of this room, |I’ll kick you out of the whole Phoenix Program. |You can go back to whatever life was so lame |that you thought coming here was an improvement. |Or you can step outside and think about what you want from all this... |why you’re here. |Something everyone in this room should be thinking about.

Robert: Yeah, you said that already.

Prism: Miss Blazer, |maybe if you gave us a dispatcher who knew what they were doin’, |you wouldn’t have to throw no one out?
Robert: Hey, Nikki Mirage. I’m standing right here. You can talk to me. 
Prism: I wasn’t talkin’ to you, bitch. Which weak ass superhero |team you come from? Fuckin’ Geek Squad?  
Robert: Doesn’t matter where I’m from, Cardi C. |What matters is I’m here to figure out who stays and who goes.

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0070-0171a ===
Robert: ...pain.
Malevola: Describes what I’m feeling...
Robert: Now I can’t take that pain away... |and I can’t punish all those that hurt you... |but I can teach you how to harness it. |To use it... to make something good out of the part of you they didn’t get.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0070-0175a ===
Robert: ...potential. 
Malevola: Got there in the end.
Robert: Unfortunately, for you it’s a curse. |Cause there isn’t a thing in the universe that goes more wasted than potential. |And despite how common it is, no one seems to forget. |It’s what they whisper when you leave the room. |“Oh, so and so had so much potential.” It follows you forever.| I’m here to help you lift the curse of potential... |by getting you to fucking do something with it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0070-0176a ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0070-0290a ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0020a ===
Fate is bullshit.
Robert: There’s no such thing as fate. It’s bullshit. |It’s just something we cling to |because we think we’re the main character of life. |We’re not. |We’re a bunch of flesh blobs with depression on a floating rock. 
Invisigal: Is that supposed to be comforting?
Robert: Yeah. Cause no one’s paying attention |if you wanna switch things up.

Invisigal: Boomer. |I think it’s in Trolls 2 also.
Robert: All fine films with a fine message.

Fuck the stars.
Robert: Ah, you’re lookin’ for answers in the stars? |Well listen, they’re just rocks or gas or alien cum, |okay I don’t know.
Invisigal: If you don’t know, why are you still talking?
Robert: They’re not even real, okay? Any message you’re seeing is light |that took thousands of years to hit your eyeballs. |So if you’re getting any messages, it’s useless, |cause it was for some fucker that died a long time ago.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Fate. Destiny. Not having powers. Seasonal depression. |None of these things kept me from being a hero before. |And they won’t keep me from being a hero again. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0040a ===
Get one for the road.
Robert: Invisigal just get one for the road. You’re still on the clock. |Fuck this guy up. Walk out with your head held high. |Finish in style.
Invisigal: Finish by getting zapped so hard I piss my pants. That style?
Robert: I promise I won’t tell anyone if you piss your pants, no matter the reason.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0040b ===
This could make a difference.
Robert: The day’s not done. Get this guy and it could make a difference. 
Invisigal: He stole a roll of pennies out of the cash register at Granny’s. |I don’t think he’s movin the needle.
Robert: He’s about to steal a quarter of a million dollars of jewelry.
Invisigal: Oh shit. Respect.
Robert: So go move the needle.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0040c ===
Take your anger out on him.
Robert: You’re pissed. I get it. You know what I like to do when I’m pissed? |Punch things. Often, bad people.
Invisigal: I do like to punch things.
Robert: I know. You’re great at it. Go be great one more time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0080-0050x ===
Robert: Or are you gonna just sit there and subject kids to second hand smoke?
Robert: Don't do it. Don’t fuckin’ give that kid a cigarette. 
Invisigal: He’s the one I bummed it from. |What’s the address?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0010x ===
Lightningstruck: Shut the fuck up!
Crony: You ain’t worried about a hero crashing the party?
Lightningstruck: No... load that up--
Lightningstruck: Where’s your boy? 
Lightningstruck: Shit!
Lightningstruck: That you, donut girl? |You sure you want to do this again?
Lightningstruck: Where are you? Come on, come out.
Lightningstruck: Where are you?
Robert: Invisigal, are you alright?
Invisigal: Yeah I'm fine. Just help me find this fucker. 
Robert: Got him. |He's at your five o'clock.
Lightningstruck: It's not fair that you can see me but I can't see you.
Robert: I'm flying blind here. I can't see anything.
Robert: Great, gimme a second to tap into this.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0040x ===
Robert: Got it. I can see again.
Invisigal: That makes one of us. So where the hell is he?
Robert: I can't see him from this camera. |Let me try to get another one online.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0050a ===
Robert: He's at your seven.
Invisigal: That wasn't so hard was it?
Robert: He's heading your way.
Robert: Invisigal, I've got a plan.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0050b ===
Robert: Shit. I couldn't get access to another camera.
Invisigal: Can you at least turn on the lights or something so that <Italic>I</> can see him?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0070a ===
Robert: Got it! On the count of three I am going to turn on the main overhead lights. |Which should temporarily blind him giving you a chance to take him out.
Robert: One... two... three!
Invisigal: I’m no hero... fuck, no, let me try that again. |Now you see me... Wait. Uh. What about... |lights out, Thundercuck.
Robert: That’s the one. Would’ve been better if you said it first.
Invisigal: Right. Cause lighting, thunder. Struck, cuck. Fuck. So close.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0090-0070b ===
Robert: Shit.
Invisigal: Where the hell is he?
Robert: He's heading your way.
Invisigal: Fuck this.
Robert: Invisigal!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0100-0010x ===
Golem: ‘Sup, Thundercuck.
Flambae: Hey Bangle Boy! |More like Bangle Bitch!
Prism: Or Bitch Boy.
Punch Up: Hey, Bangle Bitch Boy! Fuck you!
Robert: Why are those assholes not being assholes?
Blonde Blazer: Isn’t this what you were going for?
Robert: Yeah, but I didn’t think it would work. I don’t get it. 
Blonde Blazer: So, this one keeps the comm line one on one. |This one connects to the whole team. And this one --
Blonde Blazer: Goes out to the entire branch. 
Robert: Fuck.
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, you got off light. |One dispatcher broadcast the details of his botched circumcision. |HR nightmare. |Did you mean all that? You really think she has a shot?
Blonde Blazer: All that stuff about fate sounded good but, |I don’t know if you were just saying what you thought she needed to hear.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0100-0020a ===
Robert: Honestly? No, not really. |I think she’s too jaded and angry and stuck in her own head to make it as a hero.
Blonde Blazer: So, why didn’t you just let her quit?
Robert: She’s clocked in. She can be a quitter on her own time. |Or when we cut her. 
Blonde Blazer: Right...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0100-0020c ===
Robert: Yeah. Everyone has a shot. People are who they choose to be. |If Invisigal wants this, she has to commit. |It’s too easy to quit when you’re not good at something.
Blonde Blazer: It’s a steep learning curve.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0100-0020e ===
Robert: I want it to work. |Someone like Invisigal turning it around is what this program should be about. |I’m rooting for her. 
Blonde Blazer: So am I. I’m glad we’re on the same page.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: So, it’s between Sonar and Coop.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: What? That’s not-- No, Invisigal’s still at the bottom of the board.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh, the one in the bullpen? That thing updates every hour. |Invisigal moved up. |Catching Lightningstruck really gave her a huge boost.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Bangle boy? Really?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: The Donut Shop escape, slipping past Malevola, now the jewelry store... |really bumped up the wanted levels.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: That’s like missing the free throw on purpose to get the put back. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, exactly... I don’t watch football but I get it. |Look, I know I’m not supposed to play favorites here, |but even if she was on the bottom, |I’m not sure I’d have let you cut her.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Then it’s a good thing she’s not.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah. So, these two are now tied for last place. |Who do we cut?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: Sonar or Coop? It’s your call. I support it all the way.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0020a ===
Sonar.
Robert: Sonar it is. |He had to use his distress beacon before he even left the building today |so I'm not sure it's gonna work.
Blonde Blazer: What happened?
Robert: He thought he was gonna see boobs and got tricked.
Blonde Blazer: You somehow gave me too much detail and not enough detail in one sentence.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0020b ===
Coupé.
Robert: Coop. If I’m honest, she still feels a little... 
Blonde Blazer: Evil?
Robert: Yeah.
Blonde Blazer: Yeah... it’s too bad. |Alright. I’ll get started on the paperwork.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0040a ===
Robert: I’ll let him know.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0040b ===
Robert: I’ll let her know. Feels important that I do.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0110-0050x ===
Blonde Blazer: Hey, uh, Robert...
Blonde Blazer: Great work today.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0120-0010a ===
Robert: So, I’m sure you know why you’re here...
Sonar: Nah not at all man, no clue. What’s up? What's going on Robbie?
Robert: You... well, I’m cutting you. 
Sonar: What? No. |Invisigal, she should be getting cut. She’s on the bottom!
Robert: Not anymore, actually. Her last dispatch put her above you. 
Robert: Sonar! Hey, they’re gonna call security.
Sonar: This isn’t over.
Robert: It actually is. Sorry it didn’t work out.
Sonar: Watch your back, Robert. 
Sonar: Why is this... what. Did you--
Robert: Uh, no, you uh you must’ve just locked it...
Sonar: Sorry, force of hab-- fuck you!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0120-0010b ===
Robert: Coop, I’m sure you already know why I’ve asked you here.
Coupé: You would be mistaken.
Robert: Oh. Okay. Well, I’m letting you go. |You’re at the bottom of the leaderboards. |I guess all those penalties for, you know, cutting people, added up. |I’m sorry.
Coupé: But I cheered for Invisigal...
Robert: You did. I saw that. That was cool of you. 
Coupé: I only did that cause I thought she was being cut. 
Robert: Oh, that makes sense. A lot of sense actually. |Yeah, well, she snuck past you with her last dispatch. 
Robert: That's uh, wow look at that. That’s very menacing. Well, thank you. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0130-0010a ===
Chase: You accessorizing?
Robert: You could call it that. 
Chase: Did he try to choke you with that or something?
Robert: No. He just left it.
Chase: You’re lucky he just stopped at the tie.
Chase: Hey, check it out. I’ve been doing some accessorizing myself.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0130-0010b ===
Chase: Where’d you get that?
Robert: Coop. She left this souvenir for me after I cut her.
Chase: She threatening you, Robert.
Robert: I know-- trying to put a positive spin on it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0130-0015x ===
Robert: You are spoiling him.
Chase: Nonsense. What are you talking about?
Robert: You ready to go home, bud?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP03_SQ0130-0030x ===
Chase: I still would’ve cut you.
Invisigal: Well, no one fuckin’ asked you old man.
Chase: Lucky fuckin for you.
Invisigal: Thanks.


=== Gem_Node_Buying_Love-f2420e ===
Sonar: Coop, you think SDN could be bribed? Maybe this whole leaderboard thing goes away.
Coupé: Bribes? Doubtful, but, how do you think they'd feel about menacing threats?
Robert: Nope.
Invisigal: Desperate fucks.


=== Gem_Node_Coupe_Sabotaged-ad5022 ===
Coupé: I didn't know dogs could be so huge. And menacing.
Malevola: He might have rabies. Animal control guy wasn't sure.
Invisigal: He's been compensated. I gave him half of my breakfast burrito.
Prism: The dog agrees with me that Coop has rancid vibes.
Golem: Man, that's the meanest animal I've ever met.
Coupé: I've evaded capture by seven foreign agencies, I can evade a fucking dog.
Coupé: Your eyes... they are like mine. We are the same.
Coupé: I always carry dog treats. What? It's strategic.
Coupé: I would kill this dog... I'm just not going to. I have my reasons.


=== Gem_Node_Delayed_Gratification-ed7dcf ===
Golem: Hehehe, hey Visi, I just got Robert's joke.
Invisigal: What joke?
Golem: Offered me a seat... I just got it. That was funny.
Invisigal: Bro, that was like three hours ago.


=== Gem_Node_End_of_Shift-a75ea0 ===
Malevola: Stay out of my way.
Invisigal: Fuck off.


=== Gem_Node_End_of_Shift-b9e1ee ===
Malevola: Huh, pretty breathtaking work back there.
Punch Up: Not too shabby. Not too shabby at all at all.
Flambae: This shit is weird. It's like we're working... What's the word? As a team.
Prism: Uh huh. Baby that's got a name, it's teamwork.
Flambae: Isn't that like a sex thing?
Prism: What typa sex thing would that be?
Flambae: It's not really safe for work, you know. I'll text it to you. One sec.
Prism: Oh damn boy. That's some fucking teamwork alright.


=== Gem_Node_Fighting_Demons-b799d3 ===
Coupé: Argh!
Robert: What happened?
Malevola: She's fine. Just uh, walked into my sword with her face a little bit.
Punch Up: I don't believe in punching women. But I do believe in punching demons.
Malevola: Try it.


=== Gem_Node_First_Sabotage-f2d422 ===
Robert: Uh-huh... y'know. This is uh, really fucking immature guys.
Coupé: Serves them right, you let your guard down. You perish.
Robert: That's a pretty fucked way to live.
Coupé: Emphasis on \"live.\"
Robert: Oh my God... you do realize that sabotaging each other isn't going to guarantee you a spot on the team right? Fucking idiots...


=== Gem_Node_Flambae_Sabotaged-c0bdfe ===
Flambae: Nobody sabotages me except me! But that's like... more of an existential thing.
Prism: Why get in the pod in the first place?
Flambae: I don't wanna talk about it.
Sonar: Flambae's quite receptive to promotional language. He's a marketer's dream.
Malevola: I mean, in his defense, he didn't know it was a pod until I closed the lid.
Invisigal: I told him it was supposed to help with anxiety and he hopped right in.
Punch Up: Said that if he wanted a spa break, I'd make sure no one bothered him. Which I did.
Golem: Splish splash baby.
Coupé: What a fun way to kill someone, I'll have to use it again sometime.
Flambae: Blast it, you say? Don't have to tell me twice.
Flambae: Meditation is dumb. People pay money to do this?
Flambae: LET ME OUT!
Flambae: Do you see me flipping you off? Because I'm flipping you off.
Flambae: What the fuck did you do? I'm drowning in here!
Flambae: Yeah, just take your fucking time.
Flambae: Hurry the fuck up!
Flambae: [choking on water] Sonofa...
Flambae: Ah, fuck! Ah, sweet air! Oh God! I thought I wanted to die for so much of my life but... I want to live.
Robot: Emergency unlock activated.
Flambae: Drowning in a sensory deprivation tank is not the kind of wet I like to be, Robert.

=== Gem_Node_Golem_Sabotaged-dd52bf ===
Golem: Dammit, I can't move. Mud, cement – don't mix.
Sonar: Some opportunities are too good to pass up.
Sonar: Cement prank funny.
Malevola: Kinda just wanted to know if he could become one with it.
Prism: Who knew it'd be so easy to trap the big guy?
Punch Up: Technically he did it to himself.
Coupé: It's an elegant trap. Simple, but effective.
Golem: Yo, cement mixer dudes? I fuck with those guys.
Golem: Never had cement in me before, it feels... it feels scratchy.
Golem: That sidewalk's got my ass all over it now.
Golem: Guess I just live here now. Could be worse.


=== Gem_Node_Good_Clean_Shift-be8e16 ===

Robert: Thanks.

Robert: There you are.
Robert: Oh fuck.
Invisigal: What? What is it?
Robert: Antivirus.

Robert: Alright... a little more tricky.
Invisigal: Sure, take your time.
Robert: Shh! I need quiet.
Robert: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
Robert: Ha!
Robert: The fuck am I supposed to do here...
Robert: You don't scare me anymore.
Robert: Well shit, now what...
Robert: Heh. Got you.
Robert: Fuuuuuuck me... this is long.
Invisigal: That's what she said.
Robert: Seriously?

=== Gem_Node_Invisigal_Sabotaged-a627ff ===
Invisigal: Wow, betrayed by a fellow degenerate.
Sonar: He's an enterprising young man. Reminds me of myself.
Coupé: Even children can be bribed.
Malevola: It was expensive, but so worth it.
Prism: I looked for a bitch-detecting camera, but they don't sell 'em.
Punch Up: Shitty street kids love me. I'm like their king.
Invisigal: What's the matter kid? Can't climb fire escapes?! Pffft. Idiot.
Invisigal: Well I'm outta cash, but sans teen. So, worth it.
Invisigal: Great. Now there's camera guts in my sneakers. Happy?!
Invisigal: Do degenerates not have better things to do? Don't answer that.


=== Gem_Node_It_s_Not_Personal-a8d91f ===
Coupé: I remember this man and he's right to be paranoid. Secret Police hired me three years ago to kill him. He pissed off the wrong dictator, who shall remain nameless.
Punch Up: But he's still alive. Are you going soft on us Coop?
Coupé: Please. They couldn't pay. So I canceled the job. No cash. No kill. So, far, SDN's always paid on time and in full, so as long as the checks clear I will kill or protect as they see fit.
Punch Up: Uh, I thought they didn't let us kill people around here.
Coupé: As. They. See. Fit.


=== Gem_Node_Lightningstruck-cf5791 ===
Malevola: I'll handle this.


=== Gem_Node_Malevola_Sabotaged-ad4edd ===
Malevola: They're trying to touch me with their clammy hands.
Coupé: Being worshipped should only be a minor inconvenience.
Punch Up: The way their eyes lit up when they saw her... room fulla boners.
Golem: Yeah baby, those will keep her busy for a while.
Prism: You know how fuckin' rich cults can get? This is like a favor.
Invisigal: These dudes are wearing like, actual robes. Are they fucking wizards?
Malevola: I'm your punishment.
Malevola: Fucking hate cardio.
Malevola: Uh, fuck. Um. Kneel. And be... cleansed?

Punch Up: Come on, Robert, send me in to compete. I'll win so hard, we'll bankrupt every bookie in Torrance.
Punch Up: That's some bullshite.
Punch Up: Narc-ing, killjoy, goody-two-shoes, piece of shit...
Punch Up: [maniacal laughter] Alright, I'm ready.
Coupé: Punch Up, you will be magnificent.
Punch Up: Whoo! Damn, I got my bell rung in that fight. But uh, I need a corner man... or woman. Maybe Coop?
Coupé: Very well, I am en route.
Punch Up: Oh, I'll tough it out alright.
Punch Up: Fuck me. Now that's how it feels to be alive, baby. [laughter] I'm sending this belt to my mother. She's gonna put it on her fucking fridge.
Punch Up: I think I broke my nose again. That makes it an even dozen. [chuckles] Win or lose, that was fucking great.

Robert: You're really fucking with the giant bat monster right now?
Prism: You should see his goofy ass. It's like he's in his own little kaiju movie.
Invisigal: And I thought I was feral.
Punch Up: I'm not scared of this guy. I've fought bears bigger than him.
Golem: Yeah so the sound, it's... it's distracting him.
Coupé: Listen to those screams... delightful.


=== Gem_Node_Old_Strongman_Secret-e30d45 ===
Flambae: Hold up. Hold the fuck up. Punch, you and Coop took out twelve guys in two minutes?
Punch Up: Back in the day, our personal best was fourteen.
Flambae: Fourteen guys? What the fuck? How?
Coupé: Punch Up's got a uh... special technique. Real classy stuff. Maybe if you ask nice, he'll tell you about it.

Punch Up: I did unspeakable things in that alley.
Punch Up: Mind over matter. Even fecal matter apparently.
Punch Up: Tried punching myself in the gut. I think it worked.
Punch Up: These were my favorite fuckin' pants.

Punch Up: There's been fighting tournies since the first chimp made a fist. You're crazy if you think you can shut this down. 
Punch Up: Whatever you say boss. I still think this is a waste of time.
Punch Up: Mark my words. We ain't stoppin' nuthin'. So you might as well send me in.

Flambae: The Bone Zone said I'm a \"closeted\" homosexual. Since when? I skipped the closet and went right for the clubs.
Golem: I'm not made of cow shit. Goddammit. That was one time...
Malevola: There is a special place in hell for The Bone Zone. ... Literally. It's not what you think. Or maybe it is.
Prism: Radios are for music. Fuck that guy.
Punch Up: This guy calls himself 'The Bone Zone' and he's got the balls to talk shite?

Punch Up: Coop knows a lot of people.
Coupé: Indeed. And I can assure you, he's a terrible assassin. And I, as it turns out, am an incredible body guard.
Invisigal: Gotta disarm him huh? Just like Granny?

Sonar: Worth it. Next time, don't promise a man boobs.
Coupé: No one promised you anything.
Coupé: Splashing. Not the most elegant solution but... I was desperate.

Sonar: This street preacher needs to work on his sales pitch.
Sonar: Can I eat the preacher?
Malevola: Sonar, you're on a diet plan, remember?
Coupé: I will make them pray to their gods.
Prism: Think they're Illuminati? That's like, the only cult I vibe with.
Malevola: Doubt they're that desperate babe.
Flambae: If you're going to have matching outfits, at least make them good, am I right?
Malevola: Ah, supporters of Ch'aad. I know just what to say. I'll have 'em running for the hills in no time.
Malevola: They're not praying to Ch'aad anymore. I'm their new goddess now.

News Anchor: We now go live to the 405 where an unusual scene is unfolding. |Traffic has come to a complete standstill, not due to an accident or construction, |but because Phenomaman is simply walking in the middle of freeway.
Robert: Shit. He looks rough. 
News Anchor: Has the Southland's biggest hero lost his mind? |Is he depressed? Suicidal? |Authorities are working to clear traffic, |and mental health professionals are reportedly on the way to assist.
Office Worker: Come on man. Can you not do that like that please?!
Waterboy: Sorry!
Different Office Worker: Hey I was watching that!
Waterboy: Sorry!

Invisigal: Bullshit. If you think you give off the “I never masturbate” vibes |then you are mistaken.
Robert: I didn’t say that. I just don’t jerk off at work. 
Invisigal: Well, that makes one of us.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0030-0050c ===
Why do you want to know?
Robert: Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t. What's it to you?
Invisigal: Just wanna know why the buttons are sticky.
Royd: Brah, what da fuck?
Robert: She’s joking, Royd, |in her very specific, off-putting, way that she jokes.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0030-0060x ===
Royd: You two got one weird energy going on, huh?
Royd: Can you handle dis HR violation some uda place? I got work, yeah?
Invisigal: Robert was just leaving. 
Robert: I can do this all day. 
Invisigal: That’s gonna be tough |cause Blazer sent me to get you like half an hour ago, so...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Shit, Blazer-- sorry, umm you know what I can come back. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh, no don't worry. I got this... thing tonight |and they were supposed to send the dress yesterday-- |this isn't why you're here but can you zip me up? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: It's not mine by the way. |They make me wear it then it’s back in a bag by midnight-


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: What is happening today...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: Hmm? What’s that? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: What’s happening today? The thing you’re going to. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: SDN’s sponsoring a dinner, gala thing. |Radiant Valor: A Night of Triumph. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Why does that sound like a propaganda rally. There. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: Thank you. |Yeah, it does kinda sound like some sort of fascist themed prom. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: What do you think?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Blonde Blazer: They were making alterations all morning.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0020a ===
Looks good.
Robert: You look great, yeah. It’s nice.
Blonde Blazer: Great, yeah. Thanks. I’m...
Blonde Blazer: My nipple’s out.
Robert: A slight hue shift at most. |I mean, I would tell you if, like, your nipple was, like out out.
Blonde Blazer: I appreciate that, but in the future, any hue shift is a no-go.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0020b ===
It’s too small.
Robert: It might be a little tight.
Blonde Blazer: Are you trying to say I’m fat?  
Robert: Far from it. I’m actually trying to subtly tell you that, you know... 
Blonde Blazer: Ah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0020c ===
Your areola’s showing.
Robert: No cause for alarm, but a little bit of your areola is out. |It’s like a slight hue shift. 
Blonde Blazer: Oh. I don’t think I’ve heard someone say areola out loud before. 
Robert: It doesn’t come up a ton, no.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Alright, for real now. How do I look? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: The breakup story is out, |so I might be getting more attention than I’m comfortable with.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0040a ===
Incredible.
Robert: I think you... look incredible. 
Blonde Blazer: Thanks.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0040b ===
Kinda pretty, I guess.
Robert: You look kinda medium pretty, I guess.
Blonde Blazer: Kinda medium pretty? You sonuvabitch. |That’s the meanest thing anyone’s ever said to me. 
Robert: Sorry, I just have a thing against obviously gorgeous women fishing for compliments. 
Blonde Blazer: I wasn’t fishing for compliments. I was asking about the dress. 
Robert: Oh, the dress is fire. Yeah. The dress is killing it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0040c ===
You look tucked in.
Robert: You look fully tucked in, which, I think we can agree, is the most important thing. 
Blonde Blazer: Better it happen here than on the red carpet. 
Robert: A lot less photos, yeah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0040-0050x ===
Blonde Blazer: I was supposed to be going with him |but I don’t think he’s gonna be making it. 
Blonde Blazer: The downtown branch dropped him. Indefinite suspension.
Robert: Is that your car?
Blonde Blazer: I don’t have a car.
Robert: That’s gonna be a weird insurance claim. 
Blonde Blazer: I’d like for you to talk to him. 
Robert: Me? Why me?
Blonde Blazer: You’re the pep talk guy. |You’ve been through a transition recently yourself. |I think he could use some perspective.  
Robert: Like, perspective to join the Z-Team? Chase mentioned it.
Blonde Blazer: Yeah, the only candidates that make sense are him or Waterboy |and, at the moment, it's close.
Blonde Blazer: Mostly I’d like you to get him out of the parking lot... |oh, and tell him to stop with the Edible Arrangements. |He keeps sending them but with all melon? 
Robert: That’s disgusting. I’ll see what I can do.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Heya, Phenomaman? How ya doin’ bud?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Phenomaman: I have been better, Robert Robertson. |The Blonde Blazer and I have ended our relationship. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Yeah, I heard about that. I’m sorry for your... y'know, your loss. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Phenomaman: It was very abrupt. |One moment we were savoring uni straight from the urchin, |the next moment... I’m contemplating flying into the sun, |absorbing all it’s energy and casting this planet into infinite darkness |so that I never have to see her or anyone else ever again...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Phenomaman: Maybe then I would be free of the torment in my soul. |Maybe then, I could quiet my mind to these destructive thoughts.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0020a ===
Don’t extinguish the sun.
Robert: Please don’t extinguish the sun, Phenomaman. We like it how it is.
Phenomaman: Do you? These days I find its ability to rise each morning irritatingly optimistic.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0020b ===
I’ve had those days.
Robert: I’ve been there. |Last time I went through a breakup I drank mezcal ’til I blacked out. |When I came to, I was in a dark void surrounded by the smell of rot |and I was convinced I’d died and turned into a zombie. |Turns out I passed out at a urinal and somebody threw me in a dumpster. 
Phenomaman: Thank you for sharing that. You are sad enough to understand.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0020c ===
Do you have a therapist?
Robert: Have you considered talking to someone. |Maybe seeing a therapist? 
Phenomaman: No.
Robert: Do you feel better after saying how you feel out loud?
Phenomaman: Yes.
Robert: That’s therapy. 
Phenomaman: I now see that there is value in that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Phenomaman: Do you think there is someone else? |Perhaps another lover could be the cause of all this? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Phenomaman: Maybe she met a person. An actual person. |I am not a person. I just resemble one anatomically.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0040a ===
Maybe there is.
Robert: That’s definitely a possibility. But it shouldn’t matter. |What she wants to do with her life is up to her.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0040b ===
I don’t think so.
Robert: Look, I don’t think there is, but even if there was, wouldn’t that just make you feel worse?
Phenomaman: I prefer when problems have solutions. 
Robert: That’s the thing, man... phenoma...man-- |her feelings aren’t a problem for you to solve.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0040c ===
That’s not your business.
Robert: I don’t know, but that doesn’t really concern you anymore. |You can’t just force your way back into her life.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0040d ===
I kissed her.
Robert: Look, Phenomaman... |I’m only telling you this because I don’t want you hearing it from someone else... |I kissed Blazer.
Robert: Before you incinerate me, |it’s worth noting I had no idea she was in a relationship.
Phenomaman: This happened while we were together? It just gets worse. 
Robert: No, hold on. She didn’t kiss me. |She didn’t do anything wrong. I kissed her. 
Phenomaman: So, you are to blame for my sadness?
Robert: Maybe, but I doubt it. |I’d guess this is something she was thinking about for a while. |I’m not that good of a kisser. 
Phenomaman: I now believe that you had nothing to do with our breakup.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0050x ===
Robert: Blazer makes her own decisions cause that’s what people do. |She’s her own person. |And she decided she doesn’t want to be with you.  
Phenomaman: Perhaps the fact that I am not a person is contributing to my confusion... 
Robert: Yeah, listen. Um, y'know what, while we’re at it, |no more Edible Arrangements. |They’re just stinking up the break room. 
Phenomaman: It seems I have much to learn about people. |Thank you. |You’ve given me a great deal to think about. 
Robert: Anytime. Well, actually no, not anytime. |Uh, just, just, sometimes. Occasionally, barely any--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0050-0060x ===
Phenomaman: It seems the velocity with which I sat up has shot shards of glass into your chest. 
Robert: Oh, shit.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: Where was the shootout? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Parking lot. |Didn’t think taking a desk job would have me bleeding this often. |What are you doing here? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: I had a dream last night that we were fucking.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Invisigal: Usually I don’t remember my dreams but this one was pretty vivid.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0020a ===
Was my dick big?
Robert: Was it the one where I have a big dick in it? 
Invisigal: Yeah, actually. You did.
Robert: I have that one too. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0020b ===
Did I wear a condom?
Robert: Hope I had a condom on.
Invisigal: Fuck you. 
Robert: Well, I can’t have a baby in my life. |Even an invisible one. 
Invisigal: Thought you were talking about diseases. 
Robert: I am. Can’t have those either.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0020c ===
How was I?
Robert: How did I do?
Invisigal: I didn’t finish.
Robert: Not what I asked. |We’re talking about me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0060-0030x ===
Robert: So, this is why you’ve been acting so weird all day?
Invisigal: I’m doing that thing where I imagine being with someone, you know? |See how it feels, how it looks. |You know, like, trying on a dress...
Robert: You were there?
Invisigal: I could’ve been. |I could be anywhere. 
Robert: And you chose to be here. 
Waterboy: Sorry-- I’m. I tried-- I tried not to do that.
Robert: Don’t worry about it, Waterboy.
Waterboy: That sound...
Robert: Bathrooms are for shitting after your first coffee and picking shrapnel out of your chest... |not for whatever this is.   
Invisigal: You ruined this for me.
Waterboy: It’s-- I know. I know. |My apologies.
Robert: You’re a menace. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0010x ===
Waterboy: S-still working on that?
Robert: Hmm?
Waterboy: Aren’t these the best? I love the green ones, the green dew. 
Robert: All yours. Take the whole thing if you want. 
Waterboy: Awes-- my lucky day-- |I know what’s for lunch-- or dinner probably. |Now.  
Waterboy: Sorry-- I uh--  for interrupting your uhm, meeting with Invisi--
Flambae: Oh, goddamnit-- you threw my noodles away? |My initials were literally on the box and everything. Fuck!
Waterboy: I-I don’t read things-- sometimes it’s different-- |like a logo-- B-but it’s probably still goo--
Flambae: I don’t-- want the-- fuckin’ trash noodles-- Wetfartboy.
Robert: Whoa. What’re you doing?
Flambae: Whatever. It was an accident. |Just aim your dick up and water piss it off.
Waterboy: Th-that’s not-- you- I’m-- I'm gonna go rinse off. 
Robert: How would you like to have to walk around work the rest of the day with shit all over you. 
Flambae: I don’t know. I don’t think about that cause it won’t happen. |Cause I’m not a fuckin’ idiot food thrower awayer. 
Robert: It was an accident. You don’t have to be a bully about it. |You want this in your report?
Flambae: What’re you gonna snitch on me? 
Flambae: This motherfucker... [mumbles]
Flambae: You’re just being a soft bitch about it. |Bully. How am I being a bully?   


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0020a ===
Flambae: In fact-- fuck!
Flambae: If it’s in my hair, |I’m going to fucking kill you. 
Robert: Well I got bad news for you--
Blonde Blazer: Hey, Robert could you-- Oh. |You have stuff on your face. |What happened here? 
Robert: I don’t wanna be a snitch, but Flambae accidentally made a mess.
Blonde Blazer: Really?
Flambae: Yes.
Blonde Blazer: Well, you should probably go get cleaned up, |then, you know accident or not, wipe up this mess you made. 
Flambae: Yes.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0020c ===
Flambae: In factglgaarggpgh--
Robert: Oh wow I wasn’t expecting it to go straight. |That was extra. Sorry.
Flambae: You’re gonna choke on this fuckin-- 
Blonde Blazer: Hey, Robert could you--
Flambae: spaghetti--
Blonde Blazer: Did you eat my lunch? Why would you do that?
Robert: I don’t wanna be a snitch, but Flambae was really hungry. |I mean look at him.
Blonde Blazer: Really?
Flambae: Yes.
Blonde Blazer: Well, if you’re gonna eat it I wish more of it got into your mouth. |Go get cleaned up, then, clean this up, |then pick me up a BLT from Johnny’s and we’ll call it even.
Flambae: Yes.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh-kay. Whatever that was. Listen, Rob--urt --


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Jesus. Anyway, you talked to Chase. |Who’s it gonna be? Phenomaman or Waterboy? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: And these two are my only options?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Blonde Blazer: For now? Yeah. |Obviously, we can revisit it but Waterboy is already a trainee, sorta, |and you already know Phenomaman got cut by DTLA. |Thanks for getting him out of the parking lot by the way.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: It might also help to get, you know, |an actual good person on your team, |which I’m positive both of them are... |they just have other issues... |and Phenoma's an alien, not a person.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0040a ===
Waterboy.
Robert: Let’s go with Waterboy. |I think he deserves a shot and he seems, shockingly, |more stable than Phenomaman at the moment.
Blonde Blazer: I hear ya. |Uhm, I might have him take care of this mess before he starts but, yeah. |Let’s go with it. I’ll let him know. He really looks up to you. 
Robert: Does he look up to me or-- Wait, does he know I’m Mecha Man?
Blonde Blazer: Yeah... but he said he won’t tell anyone.
Robert: I guess that's good.
Blonde Blazer: I’ll let him know. You’ll see him in the roster for your next dispatch.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0070-0040b ===
Phenomaman.
Robert: Phenomaman, I guess. |I’m worried he has too much time to think right now. 
Blonde Blazer: That’s-- yeah, I feel the same way. He could use a distraction.
Robert: So, it won’t be weird with your ex-boyfriend hanging around?
Blonde Blazer: I mean, he’s already hanging around, |so he may as well be doing some good. |Instead of moping around the parking lot, crushing cars.
Robert: You make a good point.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0080-0010a ===
Waterboy: Hey, I leave-- it’s not-- my clothes are waterproof... ish.
Robert: Yeah, that’s gonna clog.
Waterboy: No. No, I do this-- see?
Robert: Didn’t realize you had a plan.
Waterboy: Blonde-- Miss Blaze she talked to me-- thanks for picking me-- |my I’m really-- jizzed to join you.
Robert: Jazzed. The word is jazzed. And we’re jazzed to have you too, bud. |I’m even reasonably optimistic that you deserve it. |See you next shift.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0080-0010b ===
Phenomaman: Hello Robert. A moment of your time.
Robert: How do you move so quiet?
Phenomaman: I float.
Phenomaman: If it would make you more comfortable, I could remove my clothes as well.
Robert: It would not. |Look, if this is about picking you for Z-Team, wasn’t even a hard decis--
Phenomaman: Thank you.
Robert: No need. You’re a legend. You should be out doing good.
Phenomaman: But to do good, you need to be doing good. |That’s what a human person would say.
Robert: Yeah I’m... sure some human person would say that, yeah.
Phenomaman: My hug of gratitude seems to have reopened your chest wounds.
Robert: It's fine.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0080-0020x ===
Robert: [sighs]


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0090-0010x ===
Chase: Not only did you cut one of their dumbshit criminal buddies, |you’re also forcing them to work with...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0090-0020a ===
Robert: An actual good person that wants to be a hero?
Chase: I was gonna go with wet baby bitch boy. |But yeah, we can go with yours.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0090-0020b ===
Robert: One of the greatest heroes of all time? 
Chase: I was gonna say sad sack sonuvabitch. |But yeah, let’s go with yours.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0090-0030x ===
Robert: Yeah... let’s go with mine.
Chase: Hey, kid.
Chase: Love ya.
Robert: Love you too, Unc.
Chase: Don’t fuck this up.
Child: Hey mom!
Mom: Hey honey!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Waterboy: Those-- they make fun of my issue-- my stutter.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Here, hold a Beef. It’ll help. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: I don’t think it’s a stutter.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Waterboy: What?-- Can you not-- it’s happening right-- currently. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Waterboy: This very-- right now. You can’t? I’m concern-- worried.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0020a ===
You second guess everything.
Robert: Well, you’re second guessing everything. You do it all the time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0020b ===
Believe in yourself.
Robert: What you need, is to believe in yourself.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0020c ===
You expect failure.
Robert: The more you expect failure, the more likely it is to happen.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0030x ===
Robert: I don’t think you have a stutter. |I think you have a confidence issue. |You’re worried you’re gonna say the wrong thing, |so you won’t finish a sentence. |I’m blowing your mind?
Robert: What’re you afraid of with the Z-Team? |Seriously, what’s the worst that can happen?
Waterboy: They-- I don't know. They call me useless, they call me, |I don't know, they think I suck.
Robert: See? They say that all the time. |You worrying about it didn’t stop a thing. |So fuck 'em. Fuck me. Fuck everybody. |From now on, stop caring what anyone else thinks. 
Robert: It smells very chemically in here.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Phenomaman: Earlier that day Blazer and I had breakfast at the rim of an active volcano. |Then we made love.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: I don’t need to hear your sex stories. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Phenomaman: We never had intercourse. |My alien genitals were not compatible with hers. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: That’s cool...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Phenomaman: Why is that cool?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: It’s, uh, it's not. What were you saying?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0040x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Phenomaman: She was the only thing I was passionate about. |Her voice. Her eyes. Her disposition... |her whole of her remarkable corporeal form.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0050a ===
That’s not healthy.
Robert: I don’t think that’s healthy. |You should have more loves in the world. 
Phenomaman: So, more girlfriends?
Robert: No. Well, maybe? That’s not my point.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0050b ===
I don’t believe that.
Robert: That can’t be true. |You’ve never had, like, a pet? A hobby? Favorite food?
Phenomaman: Every attempt I have made to love food as one loves a woman has ended in disaster.
Robert: Usually people love multiple things at the same time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0050c ===
How do you know?
Robert: How do you know she’s the only thing you’re passionate about |if you haven’t found anything else you’re passionate about?
Phenomaman: Your logic with that statement may be flawed.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP04_SQ0100-0060x ===
Robert: All I’m saying is, |what you need to do is find the next thing for you to be passionate about... |cause it’s out there.

===== CINEMATIC DIALOGUE =====


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0010x ===
Police Officer: That’s everybody, all clear. 
Police Officer: Mecha Man! It's not worth it!
Robert: Damage is done. All I want is a conversation. |No need to do any more --
Flambae: You need some help?
Flambae: You’re not supposed to lift without a spot, idiot.
Flambae: So weak. So so weak.
Robert: Now I'm getting a safety lecture from a walking fireball.
Flambae: It’s a reality check. |Normies need baby sitters so you don’t hurt yourself thinking you’re a hero.
Flambae: Man, I am so fuckin’ strong. It’s crazy.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0020a ===
Robert: I’m not a Normie, and you know it.
Flambae: Pff, you’re the King of the Normies. |I’ve seen fucking Wetwipeboy put up more on the bench.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0020c ===
Robert: Well, it's part of the job. |Heroes get hurt all the time.
Flambae: Not the good ones, Robbo. Not the good ones.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0020e ===
Robert: Thank you for being my baby sitter. |I will be more careful next time.
Flambae: Fuck off -- |wait. That was genuine?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0030a ===
Flambae: Now get your flat ass off my bench.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0030x ===
Flambae: No more hero stuff without supervision. |You can't get injured cause we need you behind that desk to help the real heroes.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0040a ===
Robert: Uh, actually, speaking of injuries, remind me -- |who took your tooth? |It's like they only stole that little bit...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0040b ===
Robert: Actually, speaking of injuries, remind me -- |who burned off your eyebrows again? |I assume it happens all the time given your, y'know, |your fire shit so...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0010-0050x ===
Flambae: I got into a fight with an actual real actual hero. |And I assure you he’s regretting his decision to tangle with me.
Robert: I imagine he's regretting a lot of his decisions.
Flambae: That’s fuckin’ right. |And you, it’s time for you to accept that you don’t got it anymore.|And pretending you still do is bumming people the fuck out.
Flambae: Now get your flat ass off my bench.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: You decent?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Yeah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Are you alright? |Flambae said you almost died under some weights?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Something like that. What’s up?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: I just, had a great time the other night and wanted to see |if maybe you wanna do a real date sometime?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Was it the plastic utensils or the man puking water on the windows that made that less real?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: There were many contributing factors.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Would that be a date with Blonde Blazer or Mandy?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Blonde Blazer: Oh, uh, I don’t know... which would you prefer?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Blonde Blazer: And that’s not a trap. I’m both of them. |That sounded weird out loud but you know what I mean.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0020a ===
Blonde Blazer.
Robert: Well, we did have a not real date with Mandy. |Maybe one with Blonde Blazer to compare against?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0020b ===
Mandy.
Robert: If I’m pressed... I think I'd prefer the girl from the other night. |So, yeah, team Mandy for me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0020c ===
Either works.
Robert: Hey, like you said, they’re both you. |And you know what, you are who I like. |So, I’ll be happy either way.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0020d ===
Let's pump the brakes.
Robert: Yeah, listen... we work together. Let's put a pin in this. 
Blonde Blazer: Okay, |have a good shift... |what the fuck? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0020-0030x ===
Blonde Blazer: Okay. I’ll let you know when I come up with something.
Robert: Can’t wait.
Blonde Blazer: Have a good shift.
Galen: Bro. You’re so lucky.
Robert: I know.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Prism: Maybe he’s got an iron stomach. |Do we know anybody like that? Super digestion?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Malevola: The Gluttonator. |But, I don't know that guy weighed, like, a thousand pounds.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Prism: Hey Robert, did you recently lose like seven hundred pounds?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: First off, you’re either shit at math or you think I’m like three hundred pounds. |I am not. I go to the gym and I work hard. |Secondly, what are you talking about?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Prism: There’s a pool going around on which superhero you used to be. |Person who guesses right wins nine hundred and thirty-six dollars.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: That's a real specific number.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Malevola: And that specific number could be ours. Just one hint.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0020x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Malevola: I mean we’re friends, right? Make your friends some money.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0030a ===
I was blue.
Robert: Fine, okay... |I was blue.
Prism: What does that mean?
Malevola: Were you sad?
Robert: Yes. But that was just a coincidence.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0030b ===
I'm double jointed.
Robert: I’m double jointed.
Malevola: What's your other power? Flipping your eyelids inside out?
Robert: I wish. Love to be able to do that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0030c ===
No hints.
Robert: Uh, secret identities are secret for a reason. |It's in the name and everything. Crazy right?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0030-0040x ===
Prism: Oh come on. Don't be like that.
Robert: Sorry. You’re just gonna have to earn your |nine hundred and thirty six dollars in some other way... |what way could that be? |I’ll let you know if I work it out. |Get it? I'm explaining the joke so--
Robert: What the fuck?
Prism: Decent reflexes.
Robert: Hey! Beef. No!
Malevola: Which heroes do we know that talk too much and have quick reflexes?
Robert: Clean this shit up!
Prism: Hey, losing all that weight don't make you better than us!
Malevola: Yeah. Chill out, dad.
Prism: I never had a dad.
Malevola: I know.
Prism: Fuck that's supposed to mean?
Malevola: You told me one time you didn’t have a dad?
Prism: Oh.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Chase: Heard the team’s scuffling with the Red Ring.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: They run half the crime in the county. |We were bound to bother them at some point. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Chase: Watch yourself. You poke the hive, you’re gonna have to fuck the queen.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: That’s not how bees work. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Chase: You know what I mean. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: I don’t actually. No one’s trying to fuck Shroud... |but if we kill the queen, we rot the hive.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: You would do that? Kill Shroud?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Chase: Cause you might get the chance |and you don’t wanna go in there having to think about it. |You gotta know.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0020a ===
Yes.
Robert: Shroud killed him, Chase... there’s only one thing I can do.
Chase: You know that’s not true... |I’m not sure your Dad would want it that way.
Robert: You’re not sure? Should we ask him?
Chase: Point taken.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0020b ===
Heroes don't kill people.
Robert: We don’t kill people. We're the good guys.
Chase: That's a good guy answer.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0020c ===
I'm not sure...
Robert: I’m not sure... just gonna have to wait and see I guess.
Chase: Just think about it. You wanna be sure.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0040-0040x ===
Chase: Mecha Man's coming back to life one patch at a time.
Robert: One patch at a time...
Chase: I mean Royd’s doin’ most of the work though right?
Robert: So much. He’s probably gonna redo all this shit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0050-0020x ===
Malevola: Who's up for drinks?
Punch Up: Anywhere but Crypto Night.
Invisigal: Flambae got banned.
Malevola: Nice.
Invisigal: Let’s go to the Sardine. Or are you banned from that one too?
Flambae: Shut up.
Robert: Good week, everybody. See you all on Monday.
Punch Up: Too cool to get a drink with us?
Prism: Don't be a bitch.
Coupé: We know you don’t have plans.
Sonar: Spend some time with us, come on, we know you don’t have plans
Golem: Be chill for once in your life.
Robert: I mean The Sardine’s a villain bar. Not sure I’d fit in.
Invisigal: Just go dressed like that. Everyone’ll just think you’re a pervert.
Robert: Yeah, um, alright.
Malevola: Let's fucking gooooooooo -- literally. Right now.
Prism: Fuck yeah, Bobby boy!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0050-0030a ===
Waterboy: And I'm also excited, Robert --Robert.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0050-0030c ===
Phenomaman: I am reasonably excited!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0060-0010x ===
Robert: Why're you out here?
Golem: Too damn big.
Robert: Well, you want a drink? 
Golem: Sure.
Robert: You want two?
Golem: Sure.
Bouncer: Hey, creep.
Robert: Creep?
Bouncer: I don’t know you and I don’t like not knowing people.
Invisigal: Well, you won't like knowing him.
Invisigal: He's the biggest perv west of the L.A. river... and he's with us.
Robert: Uh, she's joking. I'm not --
Bouncer: Not my business. But if you go jerkin' off in the bathroom |you make it my business.
Robert: Um, that's um -- I don't want to be in that business.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0070-0020x ===
Invisigal: Buy me a drink.
Robert: Is this for all the strings you had to pull to get me in here?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: You got me Sour Patch Kids on our first date. |I figure whiskey makes sense for the second.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0070-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Invisigal: Third date you can buy me dinner. |Nothing too filling though. Just in case.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0070-0040a ===
I had a good time.
Robert: That was fun. |I hadn’t been to the movies in a while. I had a good time.
Invisigal: You had a good time eating popcorn too loud while I sat silently next to you?
Robert: The silence was the best part.
Invisigal: You might like me loud sometime...
Robert: Was that about sex?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP05_SQ0070-0040b ===
That wasn't a date.
Robert: That wasn’t a date. That was hanging out.
Invisigal: It could’ve been a hangout... |but then you showed up, by surprise, and bought my favorite snacks. |So now, if you play your cards right, |maybe you can snack on something else.
Robert: Hey just to clarify are you talking about private parts?

Robert: What the fuck? Did we just lose power?
Galen: Sure did. It's city-wide. Hang tight, we're booting up the back up generator.
Galen: There we go.
Galen: Hey Robert.. just brace yourself.
Robert: Ahhhh shit.
Prism: Oh y'all can't see? I'm a human nightlight. I don't got those problems.
Flambae: Yeah it's just a little dark. What's the fucking big deal? You never closed your eyes before? Yeah, same shit.
Malevola: I mean, I can see in the dark, so this is pretty standard for me.
Punch Up: Alright, fuck you guys.
Robert: The whole city's out. Guys, this is an all-hands on deck situation.
Robert: I'm gonna get the grid back up and running. Be ready because shit's gonna be insane the minute the lights turn back on.
Invisigal: Some real action? Thank fuck.


=== Gem_Node_Power_Outage_Part_2-f93fc9 ===
Coupé: If not for these blackouts, I'd know if the Prince of Darkness returns Fain's feelings by now. This is unacceptable. I crave revenge.
Robert: Can you take revenge later? We've got other shit to do.
Sonar: Okay, so this is why my stock portfolio got fucked up. Can I at least eat the guys responsible?
Robert: Let's get through this shit first, then we'll talk.

Punch Up: Not on me, why?
Coupé: My apartment was without power this morning and my tablet is dead.
Punch Up: Ah shite. And you're in the middle of that book and everything, aren't yah?
Coupé: Fain of the Sunlands was about to confess her feelings to the Prince of Darkness. It is imperitive I know how he responds.
Malevola: Quick heads up, Sonar's in a mood this morning.
Robert: Why? He miss a rabies shot or something?
Sonar: Power was out in my place... couldn't even check up on my investments.

Principal Khan: We have a crisis. The parents started fighting over the results and then the kids joined in too!
Robert: Grade A parenting.
Punch Up: Can I punch a kid?
Robert: No.
Punch Up: You didn't let me finish -- can I punch a kid if they get mouthy?
Robert: Oh, you know what? Still no.
Flambae: My dad's the one who got me into arson actually. Love that guy.
Invisigal: So this is what civvies do to feel \"special?\" Get up on stage and suck at singing?
Robert: That's just karaoke.
Malevola: Finally, something interesting happened at a middle school talent show.
Phenomaman: On my planet parents work harmoniously with their children to lead rich fulfilling lives. Perhaps you could try that.
Robert: Oh yeah, good idea we'll try that...
Waterboy: M-my mom would j-just leave a strongly worded note. But I'd um, they'd get wet before I got to school.
Robert: That was probably a great way to get out of homework.
Prism: Ooooo nobody throws hands like somebody's mom.
Golem: Kids... They suck at fighting. Piece of cake.
Sonar: You know, we could charge tickets and rebrand this as a parent fight night.
Robert: Honestly, I'd go to that.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_1_3__Anti-Bullying_Seminar-fc1d27 ===

Kiera: Mr. Cat is out there all alone... So scared, so hungry... Please find my baby!

Andrew: My daughter was at the beach with her friends and I haven't heard from her. I'm really worried!
Phenomaman: I could be wrong but I fear the teenagers were mocking me.
Robert: Uh, well, you're not exactly \"cool\" man.
Phenomaman: Impossible. My body temperature is always properly regulated.
Robert: You know what, you're so right.
Waterboy: They-they were high?
Robert: Yeah man, teens get high sometimes. Didn't you?
Waterboy: I-w-well I'm a-uh not-uh I haven't really ever been high before...
Robert: I never recommend this to anyone, but I think you specifically should try getting high.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_2__Rescue_Transit_Workers-c21846 ===
Sylvia: Mr. Vanderstenk has requested a rescue. VAND-GO workers are trapped after a tunnel collapse at the new station. Get them out safely.. and discreetly.
Coupé: This man has endangered more lives than me. I am impressed.
Invisigal: I feel like Vanderstenk is one divorce away from starting a full on robot uprising.
Punch Up: How many more VAND-GO messes are we gonna have to clean up?!
Golem: Shit man, I thought CEO's were supposed to be smart.
Robert: Think you can squeeze through there?
Golem: Robert, I don't think, I know.
Golem: Yeah I told you. I know.
Punch Up: You callin' me short? Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
Punch Up: Tight squeeze but nothing I can't handle.
Waterboy: I-I'm not sure this guy knows what he's doing.
Flambae: Okay, VAND-GO is officially on my shit list.
Malevola: What the fuck does Sonar see in this guy?
Prism: I thought I was done fucking with public transit.
Sonar: Vanderstenk is really disrupting the emergency industry.
Robert: Can you do that uh, that scream shit you do?
Sonar: Me? Scream in a cave? Absolutely Robbie.
Sonar: Robbie, I saw some shit. I think there's mole people that live down here...
Phenomaman: Is this man familiar with ethical business practices?


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_3__Aliens_Among_Us-fc6423 ===
Edna: SDN's tolerable and inclusive workplace would make you a great sponsor for our \"Aliens Among Us\" exhibit!
Phenomaman: This looks like a job for Phenomaman... Who is me.
Phenomaman: And it was a job for me! Phenomaman.
Robert: Not exactly, an alien per se but I think this'll work.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_3__Power_Outage_Looting-de990d ===
Tina: We've got several lootings in progress and our guys are getting overwhelmed.
Prism: Pfff looting? That's so basic. Bitches be out here wearing ski masks and robbing banks? Where's the originality?
Malevola: Shut up, that's like the go-to blackout activity.
Flambae: Besides burning all those shitty candles your aunties gave you.
Robert: Alright, let's turn those lights back on.
Robert: What's this do...
Robert: Huh, interesting.
Robert: Just a little longer...
Robert: Nearly there.
Robert: Uh, that's new!
Robert: I'm unstoppable.
Robert: Alright, Central Torrance is back online.
Robert: West Torrance is back up.

Deirdre: I, Deirdre Zee — yes, THAT Deirdre Zee — need help dealing with a stalker.
Robert: I doubt Deirdre's the only victim of his. Let's delete all the files on his laptop.
Prism: Get the backups too.
Robert: And the backups too.
Robert: Shit. He's using protection.
Malevola: [amused snort]
Robert: Alright, I'm in and... files deleted.

Iliya: I am in need of a very specific type hero for my upcoming project.
Coupé: I'll dust off my pointe shoes.
Invisigal: Pretentious bullshit.
Punch Up: I've got the ol' circus routine, hope I'm not too rusty.
Waterboy: I-I used to play the trumpet... but the spit valve was an issue.
Flambae: I can pose, let the folks admire the merchandise.
Golem: Can I do my slam poem?
Malevola: I can possess a guy, think they'll go for that?
Prism: This'll be the perfect place to drop my new diss track.
Prism: The fuck you mean I'm not what you're looking for? I'm what EVERYONE is looking for.
Sonar: My rejected TEDx San Antonio Talk will finally get the recognition it deserves.
Phenomaman: I shall regale them with tales of my home planet in my native language.
Robert: That was surprisingly entertaining.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_5__Thwart_Graffiti_Vandals-e444fd ===
Petunia: Vandals are defacing the Torrance Library mural! Hurry and catch them, before there are peens everywhere!
Coupé: That mural is charming, only a fool would deface it.
Flambae: Bitches can't fuck with the library. That's a house of knowledge.
Golem: Sometimes I really wish I had a dick. It's all smooth down there, you know?
Invisigal: If you've seen one graffiti dick, you've seen em all.
Prism: I wonder if they're available for an apparel collab...
Punch Up: I'll deface these idiots.\n
Sonar: It's no Banksy but I'll take it.
Malevola: \"Peens\" really gives me the ick.
Waterboy: O-oh! I c-can do this!
Waterboy: I h-have removed the teens! No, peens! Th-the penises. Graffiti. Gone.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_6__Evacuation_Assistance-bbbf8a ===
Sergei: Soccer fans are not a fan of this blackout. Shit's getting scary, we gotta get 'em outta here.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_6__Refinery_Explosion-f9a512 ===
Mac: A mysterious fire at the refinery has been brought under control, but we can't investigate the cause with all the dangerous fumes.
Robert: Flambae...
Flambae: I would never blow up a refinery, okay? They smell like shit.
Prism: Someone's pushing on my boy's explosion territory.
Coupé: It's obvious the detonation was caused by an incompetent idiot.
Malevola: Ah just like my summer home on the Lake of Fire.
Punch Up: I'd've fixed this up hours ago.
Waterboy: U-uh, I'll get the fires under control.
Flambae: Fighting fire with fire... and punches and kicks and shit.
Golem: I just wish more buildings would randomly blow up.
Prism: Shit, this place would make for a dope album cover.
Sonar: I thought this place was OSHA approved.
Phenomaman: If only I had been there, to be blasted away to dust...
Blonde Blazer: Looks like Red Ring was behind this. But what are they up to?
Robert: Something about this feels off. Think we missed something.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_7__Stabilize_Experiment-b5e5a7 ===
Lucas: We've got a... situation... at VANDLABS. Th-they told me to call SDN. I'm just an intern—[panicked shouting in background]
Robert: Well shit, that's new.

Lucas: Hi, it's me again. You're not going to believe this but... now there's some scary dudes with scary weapons. I'm quitting after this man. I can't do this.
Robert: Do I even need to say it? Fuck these guys up.
Robert: Perfect.
Robert: Come on, this should be a lay-up for you guys.
Robert: That shit looks terrifying, destroy it now.
Robert: What would have happened if you drank it?
Robert: Can you walk me through how you fucked that up?
Robert: Drink that serum, maybe something cool will happen.
Robert: See? I was right. Something cool happened.
Robert: Ah shit, I was like, half kidding. Are you uh, you okay?
Robert: No dead scientists, no spilled serum. Got it?
Robert: Zero scientists dead, that's gotta be a new record.
Robert: Shit, and knowing Vanderstink these guys definitely don't have insurance.

Augustus: My mother lives in the Parkwood Senior Community and she hasn't answered her phone since the blackout.
Phenomaman: The olderly love me!
Phenomaman: I did not really want to leave, but I expressed the danger the city was in and I was given a caramel as a token of gratitude.


=== Gem_Node_Scenario_9__Repairs_Required-f9a36d ===
Mac: The power's back on but the refinery is still in a shit state. Can ya lend a hand? Preferably a strong one.

Robert: Evening folks, welcome back.
Invisigal: We've got a few guesses at your identity, leading one right now is Blueballs man.

Invisigal: Nah, his balls are literally blue dude, get your head outta the gutter.
Robert: Great, it's gonna be a long shift.


=== Gem_Node_Start_of_Shift-f56e04 ===
Prism: Yo, you ever notice the Torrance vibe is like, rancid?
Punch Up: Between the dead fish in the harbor and the giant refinery can't tell who's to blame.
Prism: Dang that's some nasty shit.
Golem: Man, I love the smell of the refinery.
Invisigal: I hate the smell of gasoline.
Malevola: I love the smell of gasoline.
Invisigal: Ugh.
Malevola: Ugh.
Robert: Alright. Everybody, respectfully, shut the fuck up.
Invisigal: Who pissed in your cereal?
Golem: Now that's some nasty shit.
Robert: Ugh...
Robert: Let's do this.


=== Gem_Node_Talent_Show-e2eabe ===
Prism: I remember my first talent show, I got second place. Got my ass beat by Lizzie Galupo.
Flambae: Second place? Impossible, the show must have been rigged.
Prism: I got her back though. I shot a  beam and burned all the hair off.
Robert: So, I guess you're the real winner then?
Prism: Sure am, inspired my first single too. \"Girl your hair's on fire.\"
Robert: Sounds like a real bop.
Prism: Never say \"bop\" again.

Prism: Yo, this Vanderstank guy is a fucking clown.
Sonar: He's a business genius. Everything he does is brilliant.
Malevola: Normally I'd defend you, but all of his projects kinda... suck?
Sonar: Top ten anime betrayals.
Prism: Just admit it, Sonar, you're obsessed with a loser.
Malevola: Isn't this like the third time one of his projects is falling apart.
Prism: We're busier because of him.
Sonar: He's a job creator.
Malevola: Jesus man.

Robert: All this is, is just a minor setback. I’m not worried.  
Royd: But I am.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0020c ===
We'll take a break.
We'll take a break.
Robert: Alright look, if you need to take a break, take a break. |We can pick it back up. 
Royd: No vacation is gonna fix this, braddah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Royd, |you did your best. I can’t ask for anything else. Thank you. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Chase: I heard that big bastard cryin' in the bathroom... |makes it hard to shit when somebody's doin that next to you, ya know?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Pretty distracting, yeah... |Everyone else okay? Invisigal? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Chase: Fine. |One thing she’s good at is disappearing when people get hurt. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Robert: What’s your deal with her? |You give everyone shit but it always seems extra with Visi. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Chase: She’s a liability. |And one of us needs to be objective |when it’s clear something's going on between the two of you. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: Don’t think I don’t see it. It’s all over your stupid face. |You like her. So I gotta hate her for the both of us.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0040a ===
I'm warming up to her.
Robert: I guess I’m coming around on her?
Chase: You’re coming where? 
Robert: I’m coming -- Jesus Christ. I’m warming up to her. Okay? |Our relationship started out rocky, but it’s gotten better. |Were you able to follow that, ya old fuckin’ pervert.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0040b ===
She's challenging.
Robert: She’s challenging... which requires extra effort. 
Chase: Seems like a lotta extra effort. 
Robert: Yeah. I just said that. So... I don’t know. |Read that however you want.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0040c ===
Do you think she likes me?
Robert: You think she likes me? 
Chase: How the fuck would I know? 
Robert: I don’t know, you seem to be watching everything I do. |Can you ask her in P.E.? Hmm? |Maybe put a note in her locker for me? 
Chase: Haha motherfucker, but this little bit you’re doin’? |It just exposes you. |Cause you wouldn’t be joking like this if you didn’t have a thing for her.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0040d ===
It's strictly professional.
Robert: You’re reading it wrong. We work together, Chase. |Our relationship is strictly professional. Nothing more than that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0020-0050x ===
Chase: Look, just be careful, kid. Some people, they’re black holes. |You reach out to help them and they just suck you in and... do whatever the fuck black holes do. |I don’t know. They fuck you up.
Robert: Your new look screams “I know some science shit” so I was with you the whole way. 
Chase: No. Come on. Take the day off.
Robert: No, really. I’m fine. All I’ve gotta do is sit at a desk. 
Chase: Desk work doesn’t land you in the infirmary. Think about that. 
Robert: I’ll mull it over.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0030-0010x ===
Blonde Blazer: All we have to do is get in and out. Stick to the plan. |If they’re Red Ring or enhanced, proceed with caution. |Oh. One sec. What’re you doing up?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0030-0021a ===
Blonde Blazer: You really gave us a scare.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0030-0030x ===
Robert: Turns out, |I’m completely fine. |Just sorta time traveled several hours into the future where I feel pretty rested.
Blonde Blazer: Oh, cool. Yeah. That happens to me every night.
Robert: Wish I could say the same. How’s the shift going?
Blonde Blazer: Good, |yeah, uhm, challenging. |Made worse by all the enhanced villains we’re dealing with lately. |I have a whole new appreciation for you. |I’m sorry about the pulse. |Give us some time. Royd’s a little down, but |I’m sure we can come up with alternate power sources.
Blonde Blazer: Hey, really looking forward to tonight. Perfect timing.
Robert: Yeah, same... um, wait what are you--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: I mean... you know it feels like, for the first time in a long time, |I can see a life without Mecha Man...  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Which I’m sure you’d appreciate. |It’s been nice that we get to spend more time together right?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0020a ===
I don't wanna die in the suit.
Robert: I don’t wanna die in that suit. |I think for a long time, maybe I did. Like, it was the only option. |Whether it was the suit exploding or just me keeling over in it as an old man... |figured my story would always end in there... |but not so much anymore.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0020b ===
I worked hard to be Mecha Man.
Robert: Teaching people to be heroes... guiding them... |it’s not nothing, but... |I don’t think I can sit on the sidelines. |I worked hard to get good at being Mecha Man... |I don’t know that I want to just walk away from that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0020c ===
Z-Team's more important.
Robert: The Z-Team might fuck up for a while, |but at some point they’re gonna get good. |And when that happens, |they’ll make a bigger impact than I ever could alone.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: But just when I feel like I got a handle on it... got it figured out |I think about Chase... and my Dad... and Shroud...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Then I get all fucked up. |You know what I’m sayin’ Beef? You know what I mean?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Yeah, exactly. See? This is why I appreciate our talks. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Invisigal: Are you decent?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Malevola: Definitely a house that needs some warmth.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Royd: Yeah, I tell him dat last time I come. |Somehow look worse.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0040a ===
What are you doing here?
Robert: Why’re you -- what is this? What’s happening?
Royd: Bruddah, we came to save the day... or the night. |We've come to save the night.
Malevola: Uh, that rubs out by the way. |You just have to put a little muscle into it. |Do you know where you’d want to hang this?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0040b ===
I'm in my underwear.
Robert: I am in my underwear.
Invisigal: Yeah I can see you. I was joking when I asked if you’re decent.
Robert: I know. I just need you to know that I know how I look right now.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0040c ===
This is breaking and entering.
Robert: You know you’re breaking and entering. 
Invisigal: Eh, we’re just entering. 
Malevola: Exactly. No breaking involved, dude.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: Why’re you holding a lamp?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Invisigal: I think he’s only considered where he’d hang himself -- |that corner seems fine. |It’s a housewarming gift for your housewarming party, Robert. |I told people to bring a lamp or something.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Wait wait, people? More people are coming here? To my home? |Look, I’m not really in a party mood right now. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Malevola: Not what it looks like to me wicha tighty whities--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Robert: Okay, she just touched my-- 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Invisigal: This is your family photo area? Kinda morbid, |which I’m kinda into.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Robert: Is that my work computer? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Royd: We figure it out, bruddah. The man can be mecha again.  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Invisigal: After your little premature ejacusplosion I had this feeling like I’d seen it before... 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Royd: Then Visi ask me to get da energy reading we got this morning |and cross reference with recent calls.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Robert: Wait... wait wait wait. It’s not destroyed?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Invisigal: Nope. And a buncha B-grade villains have been trying to unlock its power |only to end up blowin’ their asses off like you did. |Then they sell it on the next sucker and the same shit. |It’s passed hands at least four times that we’ve tracked. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Robert: How does Shroud not know this?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_013 ===
Royd: Eh, probably think like us. Think it was destroyed. |But he's a smart fuckah. And he gon figure it out soon enough.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_014 ===
Invisigal: That’s why we get to it first.   


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_015 ===
Robert: Which is why we’re having a party?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_016 ===
Invisigal: The Z-Teamers know every low level supervillain in three counties. |We track its location, they’ll know who has it. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0050x_Choice_01Line_017 ===
Invisigal: Then we kick in some doors, knock some heads, snatch that shit back |and you’ll be pulsin’ or whatever in no time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0060a ===
Why'd you do all this?
Robert: Why’d you do all this?
Invisigal: I don’t know. You helped me... and now I’m... I'm helping you. 
Invisigal: Just shut the fuck up about it til we find the thing.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0060b ===
Thanks guys.
Robert: Regardless of how this plays out... thank you. Both of you. |I’m... just, you know, I can’t remember the last time someone did something so--
Robert: What is wrong with you?
Invisigal: Just get gushy after we find the shit.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0060c ===
You're sure this'll work?
Robert: And you’re sure that this’ll work? |I’ve had about as much heartbreak as I can take today. 
Invisigal: No clue... it’s not like you got anything better to do.
Robert: You make a compelling argument.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0040-0070x ===
Royd: So... |one of the last pings that we got was from a boat over here in Marina Del Rey. Which is--   
Malevola: Oh Yachtie territory...
Royd: ...why she's here first. You know much about those guys?
Malevola: Uh, old money crew of ascot wearin’ cokeheads. |Skyler Arcadi runs it now. |Three generations of that family’s been trying to finger me. 
Robert: What’re they accusing you of?
Malevola: You’re cute. 
Royd: We gonna ask you some questions about a piece a tech dey moved... |But first Rob gotta put on pants.
Malevola: What? But then I can’t do this--
Robert: Yup, right on that--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0010x ===
Robert: You do understand how projectors work, right? 
Invisigal: Felt more dramatic... and bare walls are a sign of depression. 
Robert: Why is it always a warehouse by the docks? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0020a ===
Invisigal: It’s where stuff comes in and stuff goes out. |Not a rocket scientist are ya?
Robert: No, that was my dad-- what kind of security are we dealing with?
Royd: That's where it get tricky.
Robert: Shit.
Chase: That’s more than shit, you'd need a fuckin' army.
Invisigal: I’ll go.
Invisigal: Can’t shoot what you can’t see.
Blonde Blazer: Look, this is really great work, but doing this tonight is out of the question. |Hitting a secure location like this is something they would handle downtown.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0030a ===
Invisigal: Are you kidding? |There’s enough firepower in this room to take down a fuckin' kaiju.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0040a ===
Chase: Buncha drunk ass Z-Teamers? |Please. Y’all wouldn’t make it past the front door.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0050a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: No one’s askin’ you to do a goddamn thing, okay?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0050a_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Blonde Blazer: Hey, no need for that. |We take the day to plan it with downtown and hit the warehouse tomorrow night.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0050a_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: Tomorrow night? This thing's not gonna sit still for that long. |If we don't grab it, someone else will.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0060a ===
We go tonight.
Robert: She’s right. They’re ready. We’re ready. 
Blonde Blazer: Robert. No. It’s not happening.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0060b ===
Make a plan first.
Robert: This is incredible, Vis, but Blazer’s right. |We make a plan. No need to rush this.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0060c ===
This is out of our league.
Robert: You all are capable of a lot, but this? This is way out of our league.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0070x ===
Invisigal: There’s no guarantee it’ll be there tomorrow. We need to go now.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0080a ===
Chase: She said no. You understand that word? |Or has it got too many fuckin' syllables for you?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0090x ===
Invisigal: Why don’t you go walk your ass around a mall, Grandpa. |Heroes are talking--
Chase: YOU ARE NO FUCKING HERO!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0110x ===
Blonde Blazer: Whoa-- hey!
Chase: She named you Invisigal! |You named yourself Invisibitch and you had it fuckin' right.
Blonde Blazer: Chase! You’re drunk. You need to stop talking.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0120a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Chase: You wanna get people hurt? Get people fuckin' killed? |Then you need to go back to the team where you belong!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0130a ===
Robert: Hey. Hey! He doesn’t mean that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0130c ===
Robert: Chase! That’s enough!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0130e ===
Robert: Hey! Everybody just calm down!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0140b ===
Prism: This is crazy...
Chase: She thinks she’s like you but she’s not. Robert doesn’t need |to keep going out there with no powers putting his life on the line to make up |for assholes like you. |He doesn’t need to be Mecha Man to be a hero.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0150a ===
Malevola: Wait. Robert's Mecha Man?
Blonde Blazer: Chase, please--


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0160x ===
Chase: You’re playin’ them, you’re playin' yourself. You think |you’re invisible but I fuckin’ see you.
Invisigal: You don’t know anything about me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0170a ===
Chase: I know you’re a liar. A criminal. I know you’re fuckin’ dangerous, |what else do I need to know?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0171a ===
Chase: There. Now I know you’re a cowar--
Malevola: Oh my god!
Blonde Blazer: Oh shit!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0180x ===
Robert: Visi! Wait!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0190a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Punch Up: That was a nice uppercut.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0190a_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Prism: That bitch sent his ass airborne. How are you not dead?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0191a ===
Robert: Visi! Wait!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0192a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Punch Up: That was a nice uppercut.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0192a_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Prism: That bitch sent his ass airborne. How are you not dead?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0195a ===
Robert: So, we doin’ shots now or what?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0200a ===
Malevola: Chase already had his.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0200c ===
Everybody out.
Robert: That’s a wrap. Everybody out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0200d ===
You okay, Chase?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0200e ===
Robert: Chase? Are you alright?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0210x ===
Blonde Blazer: That’s enough for tonight...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0220a ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m sorry this turned into... whatever just happened.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0220e ===
Z-Team: Ooooohhh. Oh Shit. Hell yeah.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0220g ===
Blonde Blazer: Anyone who utters one word about what happened tonight fucking answers to me. |Got it?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0250a ===
Flambae: Whazaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap?
Flambae: Like the frogs. From that thing... you know?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0060-0250b ===
Robert: Invisigal--
Flambae: Yeah. So I might have to do that once a month or so as a release of my hatred for you. |But perhaps, with some time... you'll be less of a bitch to me. |Um. Yeah, we'll see.
Flambae: Happy housewarming, bitch. Your place fucking sucks.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0070-0020a_In1 ===
Kinda creepy...
Well, that's creepy.
Robert: Why is it that when old people do normal shit it feels like a horror movie?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0070-0020b_In1 ===
That's a red zone.
That's a red zone.
Robert: Sir, you can’t park there. That’s a red zone.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0070-0020c_In1 ===
You punishing yourself?
Robert: Aw, are you in timeout? |Cause you told all my coworkers my secret identity?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0070-0020d_In1 ===
You punishing yourself?
Robert: Aw, are you in timeout? Cause you were bad?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0070-0030x ===
Robert: Thought you went home. 
Chase: Came back to apologize. |All these goddamn apartments look the same.
Chase: That guy watchin’ us from the balcony? |Walked into his house thinkin’ it was yours. Sorry about that!
Grumpy Guy: FUCK YOU!
Robert: Hey! He said he was sorry!
Grumpy Guy: FUCK YOU TOO!
Robert: Okay. Let’s just--  


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Chase: You sure this ain’t vodka?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: She told you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Chase: Made quite a first impression. |Didn’t know you were into spittin’ in people’s mouths. |Kinky shit. It’s that internet. Somehow made sex boring.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: Okay, now you sound how you look.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Chase: Another thing I can’t do anymore. Fuck. |Maybe it’s why I say the word so much.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Robert: Ah. I’m sorry, Chase. I hadn’t thought about that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: I had a pretty good run.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Chase: You ever think about why we do what we do? Help people?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Chase: Put it all on the line for someone who won’t ever know your name. |Won’t send you a thank you card. |Won’t be at your bedside when you get hurt.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0020a ===
Just how I'm wired.
Robert: I don’t know... just how I’m wired I guess. 
Chase: And here you are trying to rewire a buncha criminals.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0020b ===
It's the right thing to do.
Robert: It’s just the right thing to do. 
Chase: Sure... and you think the Z-Team will be able to tell the difference?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP06_SQ0080-0020c ===
Makes me feel good.
Robert: Honestly I don't know. Just makes me feel good I guess?

Robert: That first week, Visi was gonna walk off the team. |She was feeling low. |Talkin’ about how she was born with powers that always meant she’d end up as a villain... |like it was fated. |So, obviously I gave her the pep talk. |You know, like, that’s all bullshit, you make your own fate, yada, yada -- |I don’t even remember what I said, but I do remember thinking, |“oh fuck... yeah, that must’ve been hard.” |Like, if I didn’t have you, you know, and my Dad, where would I have ended up? 
Chase: You were always good. That was always in you. |It’s what makes us different from a thief like her. 
Robert: Oh come on. You’ve stolen things too.
Chase: What? You racist motherfucker I’ve never stolen a fuckin' thing in my entire fuckin’ life. 
Robert: Chase... you’ve literally stolen things for me. 
Chase: Oh... yeah but that don’t count. It was for somebody else... 
Robert: You quietly contemplating? 
Chase: Yeah... I guess I hadn’t considered some things... |but I think the answers are out there... if you just listen to the wind... 
Robert: I see why you and Beef get along.

Robert: Is there a mic on this? Hey! Hey, can you hear me? |The fuck are you doing?
Invisigal: Oh, not much. Just lookin' for your stupid ass pulse |that's somewhere on this on this big ass boat.
Invisigal: But someone musta dropped a pin in the supervillain group chat |cause this place is crawlin' with dipshits. |Good news is they don't know where it is either. 
Chase: You know who’s not good, Beefy boy? You know who’s a real pain?
Robert: Visi, get out of there now!
Invisigal: Look, you're disappointed, I'm disappointed. |I'm sure Chase'll have some shit to talk |but I'm here and this is our last chance of getting this thing. 
Robert: Okay, maybe If I can hack into the system |I can trace the energy signal, check the manifest, I don't know, something.
Invisigal: Something would be great. Yeah, let's start with something.

Robert: Hey, I'm getting a huge energy reading coming from the captain's quarters.
Invisigal: Right. And I'm supposed to know where that is?
Robert: See that tower? The biggest one. It's at the top.
Invisigal: Oh, perfect. So you want me to cross this active battlefield.
Robert: Look, I didn't want you to do any of this shit. You're the one--

Robert: Hate to break it to you but there's a reason why I'm here right now and it's not because I love the corporate lifestyle.
Sonar: It's the 401k matching, isn't it?
Robert: I don't actually have one of those. Always thought I would die in a blaze of glory before the whole retirement thing.
Sonar: If you want to set one up, don't use the company one. I know a guy. Not strictly legal, but a juicy rate of return.

Flambae: That block of ice will be my fucking bitch.
Flambae: There's a large puddle off the freeway but, not a single burned civie. I'm just that fucking good.
Flambae: Burned a few civies but uh, fire is hot, what the fuck do you want from me?
Prism: An opportunity for Flambae to burn shit and he ain't even here.
Taylor: It might take a while, but you could try chipping away at the ice.
Punch Up: And no Flambae? What a load a shite.
Invisigal: The one fucking time we need his dumb ass.
Malevola: Flambae's a fucking bitch, always has been.
Robert: Flambae is a bitch, you're all correct but let's tell him that to his face when he's back. For now, someone's gotta deal with this ice.
Robert: Jesus, that took forever.

Robert: Well, here it's supposed to be flattering.
Phenomaman: How unfortunate, it appears I will have to express my disappointment to him in person then.
Phenomaman: I have expressed my disappointment. He seemed remorseful. There were many tears... from us both.

Invisigal: I bet this fanboy jerks off in the costume. That's what I'd do.

Coupé: Ghosts are already dead. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Malevola: Well ghosts are bullshit. But spirits are real. Can confirm.
Robert: Malevola, feels like you're our best shot.
Malevola: You're right on mate. If there's spooky shit going on, I'll sniff it right out.
Malevola: Okay, yeah, so like I thought, this lady is just crazy. There is nobody haunting her. It's just some randos living in the sewers.
Invisigal: Fun fact, I'm responsible for like 40% of the ghost pranks in the whole Torrance area.
Punch Up: Unfinished business is just fancy talk for stubborn bollocks.
Golem: OoooooOOOOOooooo
Robert: Nice job Golem, very scary.
Phenomaman: Ah, someone else who is dead inside.

Invisigal: Nope, I'm going straight for dick jokes. Can't stop me.
Flambae: I'll bring my finest propane.
Robert: Flambae, you're not actually setting the mayor on fire.
Flambae: Well this is fucking stupid then.
Golem: I didn't vote for him.
Robert: Good to know. You should tell him that.
Punch Up: The Mayor and I go way back. I kicked him out of a bar once or twice.

Robert: I feel like you have that story about everyone...

Robert: Stands for \"Live Action Role Play\" but it's not a sex thing, okay? It's like, people dressing up and playing pretend type shit.
Invisigal: That still sounds like a sex thing.
Flambae: If they wanted to roleplay they're doing it wrong, way too many people. Not enough condoms.
Malevola: Fucking nerds, gotta love 'em. You know, they even made the park into a hellhole.
Prism: Faction of Darkness... that's a good band name.
Invisigal: Ugh I wanna betray the faction of light so fucking bad.
Golem: Ooh, I wanna be a healer. Or a tree.
Punch Up: Oh I know these guys, used to be one of their \"Stormguards\" back in the day. Good times.
Phenomaman: Robert, I don't mean to cause alarm but these civilians appear to be involved in some form of mass delusion.
Robert: Heh, not exactly, they're just playing pretend. Try to play along.
Waterboy: F-for th-the Light!

Robert: Uh, sure... yeah. Let's go with that. I had... taco shits. Like Invisigal said.
Malevola: Mate, didn't you say you could handle spicy food.
Robert: Yes. Which is why this doesn't make sense as an excuse, but it's totally the truth.
Golem: Well... give us the gift back.
Robert: Nah I'm still gonna drink that. I don't care if it tears a hole in my stomach.

Young Boy: Really? When? 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Teen Boy: When I was your age, I cried for weeks when the Raiders left L.A.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Robert: Yeah, that’s totally the fuckin’ same as my dad never being home. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Chase: Whoa motherfucker, language. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Chase: And it was the same. |My pops had season tickets growing up. |Seats sucked but I just liked bein’ there with him. |So, yeah... when they moved, I was crying like a little bitch too. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Robert: Are you saying I’m crying like a bitch?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Chase: Yes, bitch. That’s exactly what I’m saying. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Chase: What do you want from the store? |Your dad gave me a hundred and I gotta break this shit anyway. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Robert: He pays you?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_011 ===
Chase: To be around your cryin’ bitch ass? Fuck yeah, he pays me. |Now, come on. Whatever you want.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0010x_Choice_01Line_012 ===
Chase: Just make it less than twenty dollars |cause I’m not tryin’ to go broke every time you get lonely.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0020a ===
[Twinkies]
Robert: Can I get a Twinkie? 
Chase: Hey, cuz you're crying, you can have two. 
Robert: They come in two packs.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0020b ===
[Cigar]
Robert: Can I get a swisher thing?
Chase: The fuck you want with a swisher? 
Robert: Isn’t that what you and dad smoke?
Chase: Right yeah. Yes. That is what we smoke... |fine, but don’t share it with your dad. 
Robert: I swear I won’t.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0020c ===
[Beer]
Robert: Can I get... a beer?
Chase: I’m 20. I can’t fuckin’ buy beer. 
Robert: You said anything... |or are you going to let me down too. 
Chase: I know you’re a kid and you’re sad and shit, but, you fuckin’ suck, okay? |You understand what I'm saying? 
Robert: I do. 
Chase: Don’t drink the shit in front of your dad. 
Robert: Never. I swear.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0030x ===
Chase: No shit, kid. I was joking. 
Chase: Keep up. 
Chase: There, bitch. You happy now?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0040a ===
Robert: Whoa.
Chase: Yeah, whoa. |Now you can be sad, like, 8 more times before bothering me.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0040b ===
Robert: Dang. How’d you get it?
Chase: I stole it dumbass.
Chase: Whoa, what the fuck?!
Robert: This is disgusting.
Chase: Exactly. I knew that would happen. |And that's why you shouldn't drink that shit. |Here, I got you your favorite.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0040c ===
Chase: Go to the bathroom, put the fan on, light it up, then inhale that shit. |Take a deep ass breath, you know?
Robert: Yeah, I know.
Robert: Whysitbur- [cough, cough] whysdoessitburn- [cough]
Chase: Sucks right? That’s why it’s for grownups. Here.
Chase: Your favorite.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0010-0050x ===
Blonde Blazer: I didn’t realize you two were that close. That it went back that far.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0020a ===
He was like a brother.
Robert: He was like a big brother to me... |I didn't appreciate it enough.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0020b ===
I was lost for a while.
Robert: I was obsessed with making the Mecha Man thing work. |Extreme focus, you know? |One step in front of the other. |By the time I looked up, I didn’t know where I was.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0020c ===
I should've kept in touch.
Robert: Should’ve kept in touch but... |but for a long time seeing him reminded me that my dad was gone.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m sorry. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Chase’d only babysit nights when dad had to deal with something big. |Working late, he called it. |I was fine being alone but I’d still ask to have him watch me |cause I could guilt trip him into buying me shit. |He never said no. |I made him run a lot back then...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Blonde Blazer: Right... |so maybe one less store run for bitch ass Robert |and he wouldn’t be stuck in here? |That’s what you’re saying, right?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: I mean, it was, but now that you put it like that...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Blonde Blazer: Hey, the only person that put Chase here...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Blonde Blazer: Pending the investigation, Invisigal’s suspended, obviously, but... |I think you should consider cutting her from the team.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0030x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Blonde Blazer: I’m not saying you should. I’m just saying you should consider it. |It’s a hundred percent your call.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0060a ===
She really fucked up.
Robert: She really fucked this up, didn’t she?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0060b ===
I'll get back to you.
Robert: Can I get back to you? |I really don’t want to think about it right now. 
Blonde Blazer: Of course.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0060c ===
Might make things worse.
Robert: I’m worried something like that might just make things worse. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0020-0090x ===
Blonde Blazer: Yeah. It’s just, I can’t help but think that we’ve already cut a hero for far less.
Robert: We had to send a message...
Blonde Blazer: That’s kind of my point.
Robert: Just gets better and better. 
Blonde Blazer: Vending machine. 
Robert: Whatever I want?
Blonde Blazer: He’s so fucking proud of the man you’ve become... |he told me that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Robert: You okay, bud?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Waterboy: It’s just-- I’m just mad.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Robert: Yeah. I’m a little mad too.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Waterboy: I can’t-- It’s not fair. |Invisigal was the one who did-- |and then Chase shouldn'tve-- |do you think he did the right thing?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0010x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Waterboy: I mean, I don’t... It seems very not clea-- unclear. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0020a ===
Yeah, I think he did.
Robert: I think Chase knew he was the only one who could save her and he knew the risk... |so, yeah, I think it was ultimately the right thing.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0020b ===
Absolutely not.
Robert: No... no I don’t think he did. |I don’t know what the right thing would’ve been in this situation. |But I don’t think this was it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0020c ===
I honestly don't know.
Robert: You know, Waterboy, I wish I had an answer for you, |I just... in this case I really don’t know.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0030-0030x ===
Robert: Fuck... case in point. 
Robert: Umm. Feel better?
Waterboy: Kinda. I'll clean it up.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0040-0010x ===
Robert: Hey, so... |you’ve all probably heard some version of what happened. |Uhh, let's get to it. Main takeaways are that  |Invisigal has been suspended so we’re a person down this shift... |and that Chase is in the infirmary and... |he’s in pretty rough shape. |Despite his... disposition, he really likes you all... just don’t tell him |I told you that. |I’ve found doing something good, always helps when I’m feeling bad... |we’re fortunate to have that opportunity... |something Chase never took for granted.
News Anchor: We return now to news out of a shipyard in Marina Del Rey, where authorities have discovered a scene of brutal violence. Details are still coming in, but early reports indicate multiple fatalities.

Prism: What’s it look like? |This dumbass kicked that dumbass out the fuckin’ door.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0060a ===
Robert: Punch Up. Who threw you out the door.
Punch Up: No one threw me out the door Robert.
Robert: Oh my God. Are you concussed? |Are you gaslighting me? I just saw you fall--
Golem: I kicked him through the door.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0070a ===
Robert: Okay, who's gonna pay for this?
Punch Up: I’ll pay. I’m the one that caused the damage.
Golem: No. I’ll pay. I’m the one that kicked you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0080x ===
Robert: Okay cool. Now that we got all the details clear-- Why?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0090a ===
Punch Up: Ah just a difference of opinion. I got heated, |got in Golem’s face. |He had every right to punt me froo the wall.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0110a ===
Robert: Right, it’s a door and I doubt you were actually in his face--
Prism: More like ankle. Which made him easier to kick--

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0130b ===
Sonar: We basically took a board vote. It’s why we’re in the boardroom.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0140a ===
Waterboy: She shouldn'ta done what she did. |I think she should go sir... Boss... Robert.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0140b ===
Phenomaman: I abstained from voting as I am neither human |nor reformed villain |nor particularly interested in this conversation. |I only came in as I thought we were playing Magic the Gathering tonight. |I am hoping we still may.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0150x ===
Robert: Who wants her to stay?
Golem: Just me. |But the team is more important than any one of us. |So, I won’t stand in the way.
Punch Up: You coulda led with that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0170x ===
Flambae: I feel the same way as Golem. |You all let me back in when you didn’t have to. |But, I won’t make you keep someone you want gone.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0180b ===
Prism: We heard about that suspension |bullshit. It ain’t enough, Robert. Not for what she did. |To put everything we been building at risk. And for what? |I like the bitch, but she gotta go.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0190a ===
Malevola: And by go, we mean cut.
Malevola: Just like you cut Sonar.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0190b ===
Malevola: Just like you cut Coop.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0200a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Malevola: No one here wants to say it’s us or her... but that’s what it is.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0200a_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Malevola: You’ve cut one of us already for far less. And why? |To send a message? To set a standard? |Well, where’s that talk now?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0210a ===
Robert: Look, I probably don’t say this enough, but I’m proud of all of you. |How far you’ve come. |A few months ago you wouldn’t’ve been in a room like this |discussing the needs of the Z-Team and if you did, |there’d be a lot more than one broken door.
Robert: So, I’m not putting all of that at risk for one person who can’t keep up. |I’ve done my best to salvage things and work with her but |as you know, this isn’t the first time Invisigal has put us at risk. |But, it’ll be the last. |I’ll let Blazer know of your decision, |and I’ll let her know I support it.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0050-0220a ===
Robert: But I’m not cutting Invisigal. |We don’t kick people when they’re down. We lift them up. |And I believe of her what I believe of all of you... |that her heart is in the right place. |It’s what took us from being a team, to being this weird, fucked up family. |Look, you’re hurting, okay I get it, I’m hurting, we are all hurting. |Now isn’t the time to cast blame. |It’s the time to come together and heal.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0010x ===
Robert: Visi. 
Robert: Sorry. I can come back. 
Invisigal: Why? First time we met you were in your underwear. 
Invisigal: Fitting, right? Last time you see me that I’d be in mine.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0020a_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: I heard everything. |You don’t have to double fire me, okay? I’m going.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0020b_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: I really do appreciate you defending me, but you shouldn’t. |Listen to your team. They don’t want me here.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030a ===
I care about you.
Robert: Courtney...
Robert: I uh... fuck, I really care about you, ok? |And I can’t have you walking out of here not knowing that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030b ===
They decided, not me.
Robert: Look this is something the Z-team decided, not me. |They took it to a vote.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030c ===
You gave me no choice
Robert: Well you gave me no choice. |You fired yourself when you went after the Pulse.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030d ===
I don't want this.
Robert: Come on. I don’t want it to end like this. We can figure something out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030e ===
I care about you.
Robert: Courtney...
Robert: You went in, knowing the risks. |What you were willing to put on the line to help me.
Robert: What you didn’t know was what Chase was willing to put on the line for you... |cause he cares about you. And he’s not the only one. |So please don’t throw all that away by walking away from this... |from us... |fuck, from me. Please.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030f ===
I don't want this.
Robert: Stop. Please. I don’t want it to end like this.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030g ===
They'll come around.
Robert: Visi. They’ll come around. You just gotta give ‘em some time.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0030h ===
It's not your fault.
Robert: This is probably hard for you to hear right now, |but this isn’t your fault.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0040a ===
Robert: I tried my best. Really. |And I think I tried the most with you... but it wasn’t enough. |I wasn’t enough. Which is why this is on me. |Okay. I failed you. 
Robert: And I hope one day you can forgive me for letting you down.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0040b ===
Robert: Look, you went in knowing the risks. |What you were willing to put on the line to help me.
Robert: What you didn’t know was what Chase was willing to put on the line for you. |So please don’t throw all that away by walking away from this... |from us...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: They’re right, I don’t deserve anyone's forgiveness, anyone's help, anyone's love... |because I can never repay it. |Nothing I do will ever make up for what I’ve already done to you. |I’d hoped getting the Astral Pulse back would help but... |I couldn’t even do that. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Visi. You don’t owe anyone anything, okay? Least of all, me. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: I was there that night. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: What’re you saying?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: I never ran with crews. |Always did my own thing, but my asthma was getting worse and |they had an augment that could increase my lung capacity. |Only catch is I’d have to work for them, paying down... for years. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_005 ===
Toxic: Now!


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_006 ===
Invisigal: Then one day Shroud came to me and said I could have the whole debt cleared if I was able to do one thing... |place a bomb on the back of Mecha Man, undetected. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_007 ===
Toxic: Good news buddy. Shroud says he just wants the Astral Pulse. |Which, we all know isn't really yours anyway.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_008 ===
Invisigal: I quit the moment I placed it. |I walked out before it even blew. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_009 ===
Invisigal: My augments conveniently stopped working... |So I signed up for the Phoenix Program the next day... |which gave me the chance to fuck your life up twice.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0050x_Choice_01Line_010 ===
Invisigal: You gonna say something?


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0060a ===
I don't know what to feel.
Robert: I mean... I don’t even know what to feel right now. So, yeah. |Might need a minute or... several... minutes, hours, days...
Invisigal: Weeks, years, yeah. I understand. 
Robert: It’s not that, it’s just... a lot. A whole fuckin’ lot.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0060b ===
I forgive you.
Robert: Well, I forgive you. |So, there. Will you fuckin’ chill out now?
Invisigal: You can’t fuckin’ forgive me. |You haven’t even... like... processed what’s going on. 
Robert: You did villain shit while you were a villain. |Does it change things that you directed it at me? No. It doesn’t. That’s in the past. |You’re not the same person that was there that night... neither am I.
Invisigal: That’s sweet but...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0060c ===
We're done.
Robert: Wow. You’ve convinced me. Yeah. I think we’re done.  
Invisigal: Okay. Sorry for... fucking your life up again. 
Robert: Well, not much life left to fuck up. So... |you should probably go unless you wanna drown my dog on the way out.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0075x_Choice_01Line_000 ===
Invisigal: I feel numb...


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0075x_Choice_01Line_001 ===
Robert: Hey, stop making this feel like a goodbye. |You’re suspended. It’s temporary. |I’m not letting anyone cut you. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0075x_Choice_01Line_002 ===
Invisigal: All I wanted from this was for you to look at me the same way you look at Blazer... |even if it was just once, you know? That’d have been enough. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0075x_Choice_01Line_003 ===
Robert: I don’t know what you mean by that.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0075x_Choice_01Line_004 ===
Invisigal: Yes, you do. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0060-0080x ===
Invisigal: All I wanted from this was for people to look at me the same way that you... |you look at Blazer. |Even if it was just once, you know?
Invisigal: Instead they’ve always seen me how you see me right now... 
Robert: And what way is that?
Invisigal: Like I’m incapable of good.

Blonde Blazer: Press have a story that an SDN hero got hurt last night 
Blonde Blazer: Asking for a statement.
Blonde Blazer: Can I tell them it was Track Star?
Blonde Blazer: I want people to know what Chase did but I don’t know how he’d feel.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0070-0020a ===
Blonde Blazer: Or we could just mention Invisigal?
Blonde Blazer: Talked to the Zteam. I agree
Blonde Blazer: We announce she went rogue and shes been cut

Blonde Blazer: Or I could just say it was Invisigal?
Blonde Blazer: She was pretty messed up when we got to her.

Mind changing the subject?

Bartender: Would you?

Get me another drink.
Robert: Get me another drink. I smashed mine.  
Bartender: Sure... are you alright? You seem... perturbed.

Beard Guy (Shroud): Oh. Fuck. I know what’s goin’ on. 
Beard Guy (Shroud): Kid probably lost someone there. |That’s why he’s been starin’ at that shit all night. |Get him a drink on me.
Bartender: Nah, this one’s on me.

Blonde Blazer:  ...with distinction at SDN as a dispatcher, for years as Chase. |But you all will know him as Track Star. |A member of the Brave Brigade for years, |it will come as no surprise that |he was willing to put himself in danger |to help a... colleague in need.
Beard Guy (Shroud): Track Star... that guy sucks. I was fast but now I'm old. Get fucked.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP07_SQ0080-0040b ===
Blonde Blazer:  ... unfortunately we parted ways with her. |She was a member of SDN’s Phoenix Program, |which reforms former villains. |At least it attempts to. |Prior to that, she went by the name Invisibitch.
Beard Guy (Shroud): Invisibitch. Fuckin’ traitor... I don't wanna be bad anymore.

Beard Guy (Shroud): Deep cover... if they only knew.

Beard Guy (Shroud): Let me replace that drink.
Beard Guy (Shroud): I respect her... Blazer. A real fuckin superhero. |I know we’re in a villain bar but, have some class, ya know?
Beard Guy (Shroud): If you’re gonna blow some fucker's brains out, nonslip mats are a must... |need some for the hideout.

Shroud: This was your father’s gun. |Kept it in his locker. Fully loaded. 6 shots. |He couldn’t have predicted I’d use it to kill him. |The first bullet grazed his shoulder. |I hadn’t adjusted to the adrenaline spike. |The second hit his upper chest. |The third burst his heart. |He was lying on the floor, eyes full of fear, |when I put the fourth through his face.

Shroud: A bit of a waste to put the fifth through that idiot's skull |but I wanted to make sure it worked after all these years. |Your father was the last person to touch this bullet... and now, |there’s a 16 and a half percent chance it touches you next.

Shroud: Invisibitch has the Pulse. That I know... |what I don’t know is why she didn’t give it to you.
Shroud: She played you too. |Here I am thinking she’s working with you, but she’s fucking us both. |She didn’t take it for you, she took it for herself.

Mandy (Blonde Blazer): I do, actually.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0080x ===
Robert: Really? |I wasn’t, I mean-- where’d all the extra beers come from?
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Oh there’s a ton of booze in the Rec Room. That’s where they got it. |I’m honestly shocked it hasn’t turned into an issue.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Shit. No powers.
Robert: I got it. Forced to open beers like a normie.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): I'm getting drunk like a normie too. |I’ve had half a beer and I’m already feelin’ it.
Robert: So, is that permanent?
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Nah. He’s borrowing it until we can figure out a different solution |for his... issue.

Nope.
Robert: Nope. Not even a little.

I dunno.
Robert: A little, I guess. I dunno. It was kinda like masturbating.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Okay I really can’t wait to see where you take this.
Robert: You know, it felt good when it was happening, |but the second it was over I was instantly filled with shame. 


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0140c ===
It felt great.
Robert: If I’m honest? It felt fuckin’ great. 
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): I’m surprised to hear that but... |I suppose I’m happy for you.
Robert: Thank you.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0150x ===

Mandy (Blonde Blazer): That’s nice of you.
Robert: I had Chase, I had Royd, I had Beef.
Robert: And of course, none of this could’ve happened |if you didn’t get me drunk that night and trick me into this shit. |I have no regrets.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Same.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0160c ===
We're just getting started.

=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0170a ===
Come after me.
Robert: I think she’s gonna come after me.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Really?
Robert: Or she expects me to come after her. |She gave me the pulse before she disappeared.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): That’s curious.
Robert: Thought so too.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0170b ===
Take over the Red Ring.
Robert: Probably take over the Red Ring, or at least what’s left of it.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): It’s hard to see it lasting without Shroud engineering everything.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0170c ===
I just hope she's okay.
Robert: I don’t know... I just hope she’s okay.

Mandy (Blonde Blazer): I’m joking, Robert. Relax.
Robert: Cool... |so we’re good?
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): Yeah, more than good. |Make her happy... |cause god knows she's fuckin' miserable.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0180b ===
Robert: So... |Any plans tonight?
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): You're asking if I have plans for after getting ambushed by Shroud and the Red Ring?
Robert: Was that too weird of a way of asking if you wanted to make out later?
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): No.
Mandy (Blonde Blazer): It was perfect.


=== Gem_Node_SDN_EP08_SQ0130-0190x ===

Robert: Really?
Blonde Blazer: Yeah.
Robert: Well. Um. Mandy, honestly, seeing your smile every morning... it's got to be in the top five things of my day, so...

Coupé: Aww... I don't care.
Punch Up: For fuck's sake Coop... why'd you have to go and spread those wings of yours?

Coupé: Send Blazer down here, it's time we settled this... my way.
Coupé: Blazer, you want to cut me? Come down here and do it yourself!

Sonar: Shroud was right about you guys, real fucking predictable.
Sonar: I could see you coming a mile away.
Sonar: Send whoever you like, they’ll get crushed all the same.
Sonar: Z-Team’s gonna stop us? That’s rich.
Sonar: I really thought we had something guys.
Malevola: Rule #19 for maximizing your earning potential: Know your worth... and live up to it.
Sonar: Mal... you... you listened to my TedX Encino talk? You said it was dumb.
Sonar: I'm the Alpha. Time I acted like it.
Malevola: That's the most beta shit you've ever said.
Blonde Blazer: Sonar, you don't have to do this.
Sonar: Uh, I know I don't have to. I <Italic>want</> to.
Malevola: I really liked you better with a coke problem.
Sonar: Joke's on you. I still have a coke problem.
Sonar: Yo, Robbie, I want my tie back. So I can, y'know, choke you with it.
Robert: Nope.

Malevola: I always knew I could kick his ass... I just never thought I would actually have to.
Malevola: Bloody fucking shame.
Malevola: Shit... he's pretty good. That sucks.
Sonar: Think of this as a growth opportunity. You've got a lot of potential. You just need to unlock it.
Robert: No fucking way. Well done.
Sonar: Oh fuck, stronger than I thought.
Sonar: [Frustrated screech]
Sonar: Oh fuck that guy was really strong.
Sonar: Holy shit, are you guys even trying?
Sonar: You just don't know when to quit.
Sonar: Your KPI's are trash.
Sonar: You know if you give up now, maybe we’ll only kill some of you.
Sonar: You really should have given me a raise when you had the chance.
Sonar: Wow, and you guys fired <Italic>me</>. Woof.
Sonar: Have you considered a lateral move?
Sonar: Might be time for a performance improvement plan.
Sonar: Shouldn't have cut me huh?
Sonar: Really makes you wonder what we could have done together doesn’t it?
Sonar: Don't you fuckers have some paper to push? Probably a better use of your \"talents\".

Sonar: Why don’t you send the real boss down here?
Sonar: What’s the matter, Blazer can’t fight her own battles anymore?
Sonar: Send Coop right now, this is pay back for the handcuffs.
Sonar: I just want Coop, send her through.
Sonar: Gimme Coop, and maybe we let you all live.
Sonar: Hand over the bitch who stole my job.
Sonar: Too bad I’ve got my shots, woulda loved to give you all rabies tonight.
